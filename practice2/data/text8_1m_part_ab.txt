that the first mannable lm to be used for the d mission would not be ready until at least february one nine six nine delaying the entire sequence apollo csm diagram nasa george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august since the command service module csm would be ready three months before the lunar module they could fly a csm only mission in december one nine six eight but instead of just repeating the flight of apollo seven the c mission that would fly the csm in earth orbit they could send the csm all the way to the moon and maybe even enter into orbit this mission was dubbed the c prime mission this new mission would allow nasa to test procedures that would be used on the manned lunar landings that would otherwise have to wait until apollo one zero the f mission there were also concerns from the cia that the soviets were planning their own circumlunar flight for december to upstage the americans once again see zond program the first stage of as five zero three being erected in the vab on february one one nine six eight almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator however outvoted by the rest of the agency he gave his approval after leading the agency for eight years he would resign just four days before the launch of apollo seven the first manned apollo flight deke slayton the director of flight crew operations decided to swap the crews of the d and e missions james mcdivitt the original commander of the d mission has said he was never offered the circumlunar flight but would probably have turned it down as he wanted to fly the lunar module borman on the other hand jumped at the chance his original mission would just have been a repeat of the previous flight except in a higher orbit this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft borman s crew would now use csm one zero three while mcdivitt s crew would use csm one zero four in the end the e mission was canceled as most its objectives had been covered by the apollo eight and apollo nine flights mission managers were also confident that apollo one zero would also cover the remaining objectives with its lunar orbit flight on september nine the crew entered the simulators to begin their preparation for the flight by the time the mission flew the crew would have spent seven hours training for every actual hour of flight although all crew members were trained for all aspects of the mission it was necessary to specialize borman as commander was given training on controlling the spacecraft during the re entry lovell was trained on navigating the spacecraft in case communication was lost with the earth anders was placed in charge of checking the spacecraft was in working order it was not until november one two that a public announcement was made about the change of mission for apollo eight previous to this thomas o paine the deputy administrator of nasa had made a fleeting remark that all options were being considered borman s main concern during the four months leading up to the launch was keeping the flight plan as simple as possible not accepting any addition that went beyond the simple objectives of performing the first manned saturn v launch going to the moon and orbiting it he made sure that they stayed in lunar orbit only as long as necessary one zero orbits the crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his flight lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the saturn v the apollo eight saturn v being rolled out to pad three nine a the saturn v rocket used by apollo eight was designated sa five zero three the third flight model when it was erected in the vertical assembly building on two zero december one nine six seven it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned test flight carrying a boilerplate command service module although apollo six had suffered several major problems it suffered severe pogo oscillation during its first stage and two second stage engines shutdown early marshall space flight center in charge of the saturn v was confident that it could solve all the issues without the need for another unmanned test flight the sa five zero three mission was thus changed to a manned one however nasa managers did impose some restrictions on a manned flight taking place the s ii second stage had to undergo cryogenic testing at the mississippi test facility and other changes were to be made to man rate the vehicle so on april three zero the saturn v was unstacked and the s ii second stage shipped by barge to the test site the spark igniters on the second and third stage engines were also modified in may one nine six eight a leak was found in a first stage engine requiring it to be replaced with only two launches of the saturn v under its belt the ground crew at kennedy space center ksc was having problems keeping to the schedule the grumman crew was also having issues with the lunar module concern was expressed at the fact so much work had to be done on the lunar module after it had shipped to the cape the ascent engine developed leaks that caused redesigns and valve changes then in august one nine six eight the entire mission changed sa five zero three would launch men to the moon and would not be carrying a lunar module instead carrying a mass equivalent called a lunar module test article lta similar to ones used for apollo four and apollo six in order to speed up the pre launch preparations much of the modification of the saturn v was taken out of the hands of ksc and given to appropriate development centers only changes that affected crew safety were made the apollo eight spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september two one and the rocket made the slow three mile five km journey to the launch pad on nine october testing continued all through december until the day before launch the sa five zero three designation stood for saturn apollo and was used by nasa departments concerned with the launch vehicle however departments concerned with the manned flight often used as five zero three standing for apollo saturn both of these designations were used at the time to refer to the mission as a whole the five zero three number indicated that it was flight number three five zero three of the saturn v five zero three the mission launch and trans lunar injection apollo eight launch the photo is a double exposure as the moon was not visible at the time of launch nasa apollo eight launched at seven five one zero zero a m eastern standard time on december two one one nine six eight the entire launch phase was practically flawless with only minor problems the s ic first stage s engines underperformed by zero seven five causing the engines to burn for two four five seconds longer than planned towards the end of the second stage burn the rocket underwent pogo oscillations that frank borman estimated were of the order of one two hz and about zero two five g two five m s the first manned saturn v placed the spacecraft into a one one two eight mi by one one eight nine mi one eight one five km by one nine one three km earth orbit with a period of eight eight minutes and one zero seconds the apogee was also slightly higher than intended with a planned circular orbit of one one five mi one eight five km the s ic impacted the atlantic ocean at and the s ii at for the next two hours and three eight minutes the crew and mission control worked to check that the spacecraft was in working in order and ready for trans lunar injection tli the burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon at the same time the crew transformed the capsule from a rocket payload to a spacecraft and the s ivb third stage had to be in working order on the previous unmanned test the s ivb had failed to re ignite during the flight there would be three capsule communicators usually referred to as capcoms on a rotating roster these were the only people who would normally communicate with the crew michael collins was the first of these on duty and at two hours two seven minutes and two two seconds after launch radioed apollo eight you are go for tli mission control had given official permission for the crew to go to the moon over the next twelve minutes before the burn the crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the rocket the s ivb third stage rocket ignited on time and burned perfectly for five minutes and one seven seconds the burn increased the velocity of the spacecraft to three five five zero five ft s one zero eight two two m s and their altitude at the end of the burn was two one five four mi three four six seven km they were the fastest humans in history now that the s ivb had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage as well as practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft around they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this was the first time humans had been able to see the entire earth in one go borman became worried that the s ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control at first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module to add three ft s zero nine m s away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the s ivb after much discussion it was decided to burn in this direction anyway but at nine ft s two seven m s these discussions ended up putting the crew an hour behind their flight plan five hours after launch mission control commanded the s ivb booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change its trajectory such that it would flyby the moon and enter into a solar orbit so as to pose no future hazard to the crew it went into a zero nine nine by zero nine two au solar orbit with an inclination of two three four seven and a period of three four zero eight zero days the members of the apollo eight crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to one five zero zero zero mi two five zero zero zero km from earth although it was predicted that the passage through the belts would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x ray or one milligray during the course of a year the average human receives a dose of two to three mgy there was still interest in the radiation dosages on the crew so each crewmember wore a personal radiation dosimeter that could be read back to the ground as well as three passive film dosimeters that show the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the average radiation dose of the crew was one six mgy coasting to the moon one of the first images taken by humans of the whole earth probably photographed by bill anders south is up with south america in the middle jim lovell s main job as command module pilot was to act as navigator although mission control performed all the actual navigation calculation it was necessary that in case of communication loss the crew could navigate their way home this was done by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earth s or the moon s horizon this proved to be difficult as the venting by the s ivb had caused a large cloud of debris to form around the spacecraft making it hard to distinguish what were the actual stars by seven hours into the mission the delay in moving away from the s ivb and lovell s star sightings meant that they were behind schedule on the flight plan by about one hour and four zero minutes the crew now placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc or what is more aptly called barbecue mode this had the spacecraft roll about one rotation per hour along its long axis in order to ensure even heat distribution of the spacecraft in direct sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over two zero zero c while the parts in shadow would be one zero zero c these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack or propellant lines to burst as it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft actually swept out a cone as it rotated this would have to be trimmed every half hour as it started to get larger and larger the first mid course correction came one one hours into the flight testing on the ground had shown there was a small chance that the service propulsion system sps engine would explode when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first this could be done by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only two four seconds and added about two zero four ft s six two m s prograde in the direction of travel this was less than the two four eight ft s seven five m s planned and the shortfall was due to a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines causing lower than expected fuel pressure requiring the crew to use the small reaction control system rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned midcourse corrections were cancelled as the trajectory was found to be perfect eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for over one six hours having been awakened about five hours before launch so it was time for frank borman to start his scheduled seven hour sleep period it proved difficult to sleep nasa had decided that at least one crewmember should be awake at all times to deal with any issues that might arise but the constant radio chatter with the ground and the air circulation fans made it hard to sleep as well as this sleeping in space is a somewhat unnatural experience you cannot rest your head on a pillow and bill anders said that he would suddenly jolt awake with the sensation that he was falling apollo eight s ivb rocket stage nasa about an hour after starting his sleep period borman requested clearance to take a seconal sleeping pill but the pill had little effect after borman slept for seven hours fitfully he awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea that left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces the crew cleaned up as best as they could borman decided that he did not want the world to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders still wanted to tell the ground they decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could be used by the crew to tape voice recordings and telemetry which were then dumped to the ground at high speed after recording a description of borman s illness they requested that mission control check the recording as the crew would like an evaluation of the voice comments a conference between the crew and medical personnel was held using the unoccupied second floor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floor of which only one is used during the course of a mission during a private communication with the crew it was decided that there was little to worry about and that it was either a two four hour flu as borman thought or just a reaction to the sleeping pill in fact it is now thought that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness it had never arisen on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini as they had been too small to move freely in in flight footage of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the moon in the center is frank borman the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight with little happening except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast for three one hours after launch the camera used was two kg and broadcast in black and white only using a vidicon tube it had two lenses a very wide angle one six zero lens and a telephoto nine lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared however this proved impossible as the narrow angle lens was difficult to aim without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at also without proper filters the image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could do was show the people watching back on earth a bright blob after broadcasting for one seven minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the high gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother happy birthday by this time the planned sleep periods had completely been abandoned three two hours into the flight lovell went to bed three hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to bed after taking a sleeping pill somewhat strangely the crew were unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise three of the five windows had fogged up due to outgassed oils from the silicone sealant and due to the attitude required for the ptc the moon was almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft in fact it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time a second television broadcast came at five five hours this time the crew had managed to rig up filters meant for the still cameras so that they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth and what was visible and the colors that could be seen the transmission lasted two three minutes lunar sphere of influence at about five five hours and four zero minutes into the flight the crew of apollo eight became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body or to put it another way the moon s gravitational force became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened they were three eight seven five nine mi six two three seven seven km from the moon and had a speed of three nine nine zero ft s one two one six m s with respect to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew as they still calculated their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center and would do so until they performed their last midcourse correction when they would switch to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit it was only thirteen hours until they would be in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion was a second midcourse correction it was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by two zero ft s zero six m s in effect lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly six one hours after launch about two four two zero zero mi three nine zero zero zero km from the moon the crew burned the rcs for one one seconds they would now pass seven one seven mi one one five four km from the lunar surface at six four hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion one loi one this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a go no go decision the crew was told at six eight hours they were go and riding the best bird we can find at six eight hours and five eight minutes the spacecraft went behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with ten minutes before the loi one the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place then they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface but the burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit igniting at six nine hours eight minutes and one six seconds after launch the sps burned for four minutes and one three seconds placing the crew of apollo eight in orbit around the moon the crew described this as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the right amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space if it lasted too long they could have ended up impacting the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next two zero hours the first earthrise photographed by humans on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the moon however this time came and went without apollo eight reappearing and then exactly at the predicted moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a one nine three three mi by six nine five mi three one one one km by one one one nine km orbit about the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like the moon is essentially grey no color looks like plaster of paris or sort of a grayish beach sand we can see quite a bit of detail the sea of fertility doesn t stand out as well here as it does back on earth there s not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters the craters are all rounded off there s quite a few of them some of them are newer many of them look like especially the round ones look like hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort langrenus is quite a huge crater it s got a central cone to it the walls of the crater are terraced about six or seven different s on the way down lovell continued to describe the terrain that they were passing over one of the crew s major tasks was reconnaissance of the planned landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that would be the apollo one one landing site the launch time of apollo eight had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for the site a film camera had been set up in one of the windows to record a frame every second of the moon below and bill anders would spend much of the next two zero hours taking as many photographs as he could of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew would take seven zero zero photographs of the moon and one five zero of the earth a portion of the lunar near side the large crater in the bottom half of the photo is goclenius throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with the earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a go no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up the television to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed the eleven second loi two burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to seven zero zero mi by seven one three mi one one two six km by one one four eight km over the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church as he was meant to lay read during the midnight service at st christopher s episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo eight flight was unable a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service it was as the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front that the crew witnessed an event never before seen earthrise anders glanced out the window and saw a blue and white orb and realized it was the earth instantly the crew understood that they needed to take a photograph of this anders took both the first photograph which was black and white and then later the more famous color photo after the flight borman and anders both claimed they took the first earthrise photo lovell also did but more as a joke than anything else it was determined that it was probably anders earth as seen from apollo eight december two four one nine six eight nasa anders continued to take photographs while lovell took the controls of the spacecraft so that borman could get some rest as always resting was difficult in the cramped and noisy capsule though borman was able to doze for two orbits he would awaken at times to ask a question about their status only to be told that everything was going fine borman did wake up however when he started to hear his fellow crewmembers make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired having not had a good night s sleep in over three days taking command he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed at first anders protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed at last anders agreed as long as the commander would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted to crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding type of existence or expanse of nothing and then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth the only thing left for the crew now was to perform the trans earth injection or tei which would occur two hours after the end of the television transmission this was the most critical burn of the whole flight if the sps failed to ignite then the crew would be stuck in orbit around the moon with only about five more days of oxygen and no chance of escape and once again the burn had to be performed while the crew was out of contact with earth on the far side of the moon the burn occurred perfectly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re emerged from behind the moon at eight nine hours two eight minutes and three nine seconds the exact time predicted when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the capcom replied that s affirmative you are the best ones to know it was christmas day one nine six eight rupes cauchy in eastern mare tranquillitatis unplanned manual re alignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard however an accidental entry erased some of the computer s memory which caused the inertial measuring unit imu to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift off and fire the thrusters to correct the module s attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the module s attitude they realized they would have to re enter data that would tell the computer its real position it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another fifteen minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re alignment under more critical conditions during the apollo one three mission after that module s imu had to be turned off to conserve energy in his one nine nine four book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo one three later re titled apollo one three when the movie based on it apollo one three came out lovell wrote my training on apollo eight came in handy in that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew however in subsequent interviews lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake as described in robert zimmerman s one nine nine eight book genesis the story of apollo eight cruise back to earth and re entry the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would re enter two days after tei and splashdown in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth and final television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they had finished broadcasting they found a small present from deke slayton in the food locker real turkey with stuffing and three miniature bottles of brandy which remained unopened there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the apollo eight command module on the deck of the uss yorktown after two uneventful days the crew prepared for re entry the computer would control the re entry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward if the computer broke down borman would take over after separating from the service module all the crew could do was sit and wait six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earth s horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists as they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the capsule the capsule started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at six g five nine m s with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the capsule apollo eight rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at three zero zero zero zero feet nine km the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at one zero zero zero zero feet three km by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was estimated to be when it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down in what was termed stable two position as they were buffeted by a one zero foot three m swell borman was sick waiting for the three floatation balloons to right the capsule it was four three minutes after splashdown before the first frogman from the uss yorktown arrived as the capsule had landed before sunrise forty five minutes later they were on the deck of the aircraft carrier the command module is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and frank borman s spacesuit jim lovell s spacesuit can be found at nasa s glenn research center historical importance apollo eight came at the end of one nine six eight a year that had seen much upheaval around the world soviet tanks had put a stop to the prague spring in czechoslovakia martin luther king jr and robert f kennedy had been assassinated the vietnam war had escalated with the tet offensive university campuses across the united states had seen rioting and occupation of buildings by students may had seen rioting in paris that almost led to revolution yet over all these other events time magazine chose the crew of apollo eight as their men of the year for one nine six eight recognizing them as the people that most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people to ever leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fifty fifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo eight can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that simply stated thank you apollo eight you saved one nine six eight january three one nine six nine cover of time magazine with the apollo eight crew one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon although it was not the first image taken of the whole earth nor would it be the last this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture some regard the picture as being the start of the environmentalist movement with the first earth day in one nine seven zero the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercury atlas six by john glenn in one nine six two there were one two zero zero journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage being broadcast in five four countries in one five different languages the soviet newspaper pravda even covered the flight without the usual anti american editorializing it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon it had a tremendous impact touring the world after the mission borman met with pope paul vi he was told i have spent my entire life trying to say to the world what you did on christmas eve the militant atheist madalyn murray o hair later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis she wished the courts to ban us astronauts who were all government employees from public prayer in space this was eventually rejected by the courts but it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo one one took communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time crew frank borman flew on gemini seven cassutt michael one nine nine

over two eight zero zero zero crew days or a cumulative total of seven six seven years in space including over one zero zero crew days of spacewalks a person who has traveled in space is said to hold astronaut wings astronauts from at least three four countries have gone into space international variations by convention a space traveller employed by the russian aviation and space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut cosmonaut is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt which in turn derives from the greek words kosmos universe and nautes sailor in the usa a space traveller is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words stron star and nautes sailor for the most part cosmonaut and astronaut are synonyms in all languages and the usage of choice is often dictated by political reasons however in the united states the term astronaut is typically applied to the individual as soon as training begins while in russia an individual is not labeled a cosmonaut until successful space flight the first known use of the term was by neil r jones in his short story the death s head meteor in one nine three zero on march one four one nine nine five astronaut norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle arguably becoming the first american cosmonaut in the process european outside of the uk space travellers are sometimes especially in french speaking countries called spationauts a hybrid word formed from the latin spatium space and greek nautes sailor apart from the soviet union europe has not yet produced manned spacecraft but has sent men and women into space in cooperation with russia and the united states taikonaut is sometimes used in english for astronauts from china by western news media the term was coined in may one nine nine eight by chiew lee yih from malaysia who used it first in newsgroups almost simultaneously chen lan coined it for use in the western media based on the term t ik ng literally great emptiness chinese for space in chinese itself however a single term y h ng yu n universe navigator has long been used for astronauts the closest term using taikong is a colloquialism t ik ng r n space person which refers to people who have actually been in space official english texts issued by the chinese government use astronaut space milestones yuri gagarin

of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a satirical pamphlet written by jonathan swift in one seven two nine the work has now become one of the epitomes of satire and the modern phrase a modest proposal derives from the work theme the work is written in first person point of view however the narrator should not be confused with swift himself because the writer is merely a persona he argues through economic reasoning as well as a self righteous moral stance for a way to turn the problem of squalor among the catholics in ireland into its own solution his proposal is to fatten up the undernourished children and feed them to ireland s rich land owners children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one thus combating overpopulation and unemployment sparing families the expense of child rearing while providing them with a little extra income improving the culinary experience of the wealthy and contributing to the overall economic well being of the nation he offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold their weight and price and the projected consumption patterns he suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more he also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality husbands will treat their wives with more respect and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown his conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve ireland s complex social political and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed this is widely believed to be the greatest example of sustained irony in the history of the english language reactions the satirical intent of a modest proposal was misunderstood by many of swift s peers and he was harshly criticized for writing prose in such exceptionally bad taste he came close to losing his patronage because of this essay the misunderstanding of the intent of the satirical attack came about largely because of the disparity between the satirical intent of the cannibalistic proposal and the sincere tone of the narrative voice modern usage in modern usage the phrase modest proposal has come to indicate a proposal that is anything but modest such a proposal may serve to advance a cause or argument by promoting discussion on the merits of the argument s opposite other examples of modest proposals modest proposals and other literary hoaxes report from iron mountain sokal affair miscegenation origin of the

group one iupac style of the periodic table excluding hydrogen in all but one rare circumstance lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr they are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental form in nature the alkali metals are silver colored caesium has a golden tinge soft low density metals which react readily with halogens to form ionic salts and with water to form strongly alkaline basic hydroxides these elements all have one electron in their outermost shell so the energetically preferred state of achieving a filled electron shell is to lose one electron to form a singly charged positive ion hydrogen with a solitary electron is sometimes placed at the top of group one but it is not an alkali metal except under extreme circumstances as metallic hydrogen rather it exists naturally as a diatomic gas removal of its single electron requires considerably more energy than removal of the outer electron for the alkali metals as in the halogens only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom so hydrogen can in some circumstances behave like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion binary compounds of hydride with the alkali metals and some transition metals have been prepared under extremely high pressure such as is found at the core of jupiter hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal see metallic hydrogen alkali metals periodic table in logic the argument form or test form of an argument results from replacing the different words or sentences that make up the argument with letters along the lines of algebra the letters represent logical variables the sentence forms which classify argument forms of common arguments important are studied in college logic here is an example of an argument a all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal we can rewrite argument a by putting each sentence on its own line b all humans are mortal socrates is human therefore socrates is mortal to demonstrate the important notion of the form of an argument substitute letters for similar items throughout b c all s are p a is s therefore a is p all we have done in c is to put s for human and humans p for mortal and a for socrates what results c is the form of the original argument in a so argument form c is the form of argument a moreover each individual sentence of c is the sentence form of its respective sentence in a attention is given to argument and sentence form because form is what makes an argument valid or cogent some examples of valid arguments forms are modus ponens modus tollens and the disjunctive syllogism two invalid argument forms are affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent see also analytic proposition synthetic proposition logic an alphabet is a complete standardized set of letters basic written symbols each of which roughly represents a phoneme of a spoken language either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past there are other systems of writing such as logograms in which each symbol represents a morpheme or word and syllabaries in which each symbol represents a syllable the word alphabet itself comes from alpha and beta the first two symbols of the greek alphabet there are dozens of alphabets in use today most of them are linear which means that they are made up of lines notable exceptions are the braille alphabet morse code and the cuneiform alphabet of the ancient city of ugarit types the term alphabet is currently used by linguists both in a wider and in a narrower sense in the wider sense the term refers to any script that is segmental on the phoneme level i e that has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other subtypes abjads and abugidas the three types differ from each other in the way vowels are treated in relation to consonants abjads record only consonants and leave vowels or most vowels unexpressed in abugidas the vowels are indicated by diacritical marks or systematic modification of the form of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense both consonants and vowels have separate symbols the first alphabet in the wider sense was the proto canaanite alphabet an abjad which through its successor phoenician became the ancestor of all later alphabets the first alphabet in the narrow sense was the greek alphabet examples of present day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas are used to write amharic hindi and thai the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as a glyph stands for a consonant and is rotated to represent the vowel rather than each consonant vowel combination being represented by a separate glyph as in a true syllabary the boundaries between these three types are not always clear cut for example iraqi kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short a was not written as in the abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the amharic abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the system is learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad became logographic see below thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on the treatment of tone though there are as yet no names to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates the tone more rarely a script has separate letters for the tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for many of these languages regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas alphabets can be quite small the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of one eight letters including the okina and five long vowels while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated that is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for example a comma shaped letter represented g d y k and j however such simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated in later pahlavi papyri up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but had to be learned as word symbols that is as logograms like egyptian demotic the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of five three letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for k and j though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to five eight with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english the largest known abjad is sindhi with five one letters the largest true alphabets include kabardian and abxaz for cyrillic with five eight and five six letters respectively and slovak for the latin alphabet with four six however these scripts either include di and tri graphs similar to spanish ch or diacritics like slovak the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent is probably georgian with four one letters syllabaries typically include five zero to four zero zero glyphs though the m ra pirah language of brazil would require only two four if tone were not indicated and rotokas three zero and the glyphs of logographic systems number from the hundreds to the thousands thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script it is not always clear what constitutes a distinct alphabet french uses the same basic alphabet as english but many of the letters can carry diacritic and other marks for example or in french these marks are not considered to create additional letters however in icelandic the accented letters such as and are considered distinct letters of the alphabet some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as in old english and in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth of old english and icelandic which came from d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian or italian which only uses the letters j k x y and w for foreign words spelling each language may establish certain general rules that govern the association between letters and phonemes but depending on the language these rules may or may not be consistently followed in a perfectly phonological alphabet the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling however languages often evolve independently of their writing systems and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language languages may fail to achieve a one to one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways a language may represent a given phoneme with a combination of letters rather than just a single letter two letter combinations are called digraphs and three letter groups are called trigraphs kabardian uses a tesseragraph four letters for one of its phonemes a language may represent the same phoneme with two different letters or combinations of letters a language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word a language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries or the various rules in english for spelling words from latin and greek or the original germanic vocabulary national languages generally elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard however with an international language with wide variations in its dialects such as english it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet some national languages like finnish have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one to one correspondence between letters and phonemes the italian verb corresponding to spell compitare is unknown to many italians because the act of spelling itself is almost never needed each phoneme of standard italian is represented in only one way however pronunciation cannot always be predicted from spelling because certain letters are pronounced in more than one way in standard spanish it is possible to tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa this is because certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme however are languages such as english and irish where the spelling of many words simply has to be memorized as they do not correspond to sounds in a consistent way for english this is because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels however even english has general rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time the sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet a standard for this is the international phonetic alphabet collation an alphabet also serves to establish an order among letters that can be used for sorting entries in lists called collating note that the order does not have to be constant among different languages using this alphabet for examples see latin alphabet collating in other languages in recent years the unicode initiative has attempted to collate most of the world s known writing systems into a single character encoding as well as its primary purpose of standardising computer processing of non roman scripts the unicode project has provided a focus for script related scholarship the alphabet effect some communication theorists notably those associated with the so called toronto school of communications such as marshall mcluhan harold innis and more recently robert k logan have advanced hypotheses to the effect that alphabetic scripts in particular have served to promote and encourage the skills of analysis coding decoding and classification this set of hypotheses may be known as the alphabet effect after the title of logan s one nine eight six work the theory claims that a greater level of abstraction is required due to the greater economy of symbols in alphabetic systems and this abstraction needed to interpret phonemic symbols in turn has contributed in some way to the development of the societies which use it proponents of this theory hold that the development of alphabetic as distinct to other types of writing systems has made a significant impact on western thinking and development because it introduced a new level of abstraction analysis and classification mcluhan and logan one nine seven seven postulates that as a result of these skills the use of the alphabet created an environment conducive to the development of codified law monotheism abstract science deductive logic objective history and individualism according to logan all of these innovations including the alphabet arose within the very narrow geographic zone between the tigris euphrates river system and the aegean sea and within the very narrow time frame between two zero zero zero b c and five zero zero b c logan two zero zero four however many of these abstractions first occurred in societies which did not use an alphabet such as the codified law of hammurabi in babylonia which predated similar codes in societies with the alphabet since the alphabet quickly spread to become nearly ubiquitous it is difficult to trace cause and effect in this matter see also abecedarium abjad abugida akshara alphabetical order alphabets derived from the latin artificial scripts

found in the nucleus of an atom in an atom of neutral charge the number of electrons also equals the atomic number the atomic number originally meant the number of an element s place in the periodic table when mendeleyev arranged the known chemical elements grouped by their similarities in chemistry it was noticeable that placing them in strict order of atomic mass resulted in some mismatches iodine and tellurium if listed by atomic mass appeared to be in the wrong order and would fit better if their places in the table were swapped placing them in the order which fit chemical properties most closely their number in the table was their atomic number this number appeared to be approximately proportional to the mass of the atom but as the discrepancy showed reflected some other property than mass the anomalies in this sequence were finally explained after research by henry gwyn jeffreys moseley in one nine one three moseley discovered a strict relationship between the x ray diffraction spectra of elements and their correct location in the periodic table it was later shown that the atomic number corresponds to the electric charge of the nucleus in other words the number of protons it is the charge which gives elements their chemical properties rather than the atomic mass the atomic number is closely related to the mass number although they should not be confused

eight anatomy from the greek anatomia from anatemnein to cut up cut open is the branch of biology that deals with the structure and organization of living things it can be divided into animal anatomy zootomy and plant anatomy phytonomy furthermore anatomy can be covered either regionally or systemically that is studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest for the former or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systmes for the latter major branches of anatomy include comparative anatomy histology and human anatomy animal anatomy animal anatomy may include the study of the structure of different animals when it is called comparative anatomy or animal morphology or it may be limited to one animal only in which case it is spoken of as special anatomy human anatomy from a utilitarian point of view the study of humans is the most important division of special anatomy and this human anatomy may be approached from different points of view from that of medicine it consists of a knowledge of the exact form position size and relationship of the various structures of the healthy human body and to this study the term descriptive or topographical human anatomy is given though it is often less happily spoken of as anthropotomy so intricate is the human body that only a small number of professional human anatomists after years of patient observation are complete masters of all its details most of them specialize on certain parts such as the brain or viscera contenting themselves with a good working knowledge of the rest topographical anatomy must be learned by repeated dissection and inspection of dead human bodies it is no more a science than a pilot s knowledge is and like that knowledge must be exact and available in moments of emergency from the morphological point of view however human anatomy is a scientific and fascinating study having for its object the discovery of the causes which have brought about the existing structure of humans and needing a knowledge of the allied sciences of embryology or developmental biology phylogeny and histology pathological anatomy or morbid anatomy is the study of diseased organs while sections of normal anatomy applied to various purposes receive special names such as medical surgical gynaecological artistic and superficial anatomy the comparison of the anatomy of different races of humans is part of the science of physical anthropology or anthropological anatomy in the present edition of this work the subject of anatomy is treated systematically rather than topographically each anatomical article contains first a description of the structures of an organ or system such as nerves arteries heart and so forth as it is found in humans this is followed by an account of the development embryology and comparative anatomy morphology as far as vertebrate animals are concerned but only those parts of the lower animals which are of interest in explaining human body structure are here dealt with the articles have a twofold purpose first to give enough details of structure to make the articles on physiology surgery medicine and pathology intelligible and secondly to give the non expert inquirer or the worker in some other branch of science the chief theories on which the modern scientific groundwork of anatomy is built major body systems circulatory

affirming the consequent is the logical equivalent of assuming the converse of a statement to be true the fallacy of affirming the consequent occurs when a hypothetical proposition comprising an antecedent and a consequent asserts that the truthhood of the consequent implies the truthhood of the antecedent this is fallacious because it assumes a bidirectionality when it does not necessarily exist this fallacy has the following argument form if p then q q therefore p this logical error is called the fallacy of affirming the consequent because it is mistakenly concluded from the second premise that the affirmation of the consequent entails the truthhood of the antecedent one way to demonstrate the invalidity is to use a counterexample here is an argument that is obviously incorrect if stephen king wrote the bible p then stephen king is a good writer q stephen king is a good writer q therefore stephen king wrote the bible p the previous argument was obviously incorrect but the next argument may be more deceiving if someone is human p then she is mortal q anna is mortal q therefore anna is human p but in fact anna can be a cat very much a mortal but not a human one however be aware that a similar argument form is valid in which the first premise asserts if and only if rather than if similarly the converse of a statement can be validly assumed to be true so long as the

russia and one of the greatest in the history of cinema biography tarkovsky son of the prominent poet arseniy tarkovsky was a product of the golden era of soviet arts education he received a classical education in moscow studying music and arabic before training for over five years at the vgik film school studying directly under mikhail romm among others he also worked as a geologist in siberia although the orthodox christian symbolism of his films led to prevarication and occasional suppression of the finished product by the soviet authorities the soviet mosfilm studio system enabled him to make films that would not have been commercially viable in the west however tarkovsky s principal complaint about his treatment by the authorities was that he had many more ideas in him than he was allowed to bring to the screen and in one nine eight four after shooting nostalghia in italy he decided not to return to russia he made only one more film the sacrifice a european co production filmed

france france work tarkovsky s films are characterised by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and memorable images of exceptional beauty recurring motifs in his films are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time the speedy jump cutting style that is prevalent in mtv videos and hollywood movies by contrast overrides any sense of time by imposing the editor s viewpoint by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day the sacrifice is the only film that truly reflects this ambition it is also considered by many to be a near perfect reflection of the sculpting in time theory filmography the killers one nine five

meanings d nal troddyn a treatise on language vol two two zero zero four a word phrase sentence or other communication is called ambiguous if it can be interpreted in more than one way ambiguity is distinct from vagueness which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct lexical ambiguity arises when context is insufficient to determine the sense of a single word that has more than one meaning for example the word bank has several meanings including financial institution and edge of a river but if someone says i deposited one zero zero in the bank the intended meaning is clear more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional that s a good hammer exemplary she s a good student pleasing this is good soup moral he is a good person and probably other similar things i have a good daughter isn t clear about which sense is intended syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can be parsed in more than one way he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies which were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies spoken language can also contain lexical ambiguities where there is more than one way to break up a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream this is rarely a problem due to the use of context philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others will think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth although in writing the correct insertion or omission of a comma after taxes removes ambiguity here the politician hopes that each will interpret the statement in the way he wants and both will think the politician is on his side the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation also rely on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in literature and rhetoric on the other hand ambiguity can be a useful tool groucho marx s classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas what he was doing in my pajamas i ll never know songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title don t it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness in narrative ambiguty can be introduced in several ways motive plot character f scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby in music pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous such

marsupial bilbies and bandicoots of australasia which are not placental mammals at all the oldest known tubulidentata fossils have been found in kenya and date to the early miocene although the relationships of tubulidentata are unknown they are probably ungulates they spread to europe and southern asia during the later miocene and early pliocene periods three genera of the family orycteropodidae are known leptorycteropus myorycteropus and orycteropus the surviving aardvark a genus from madagascar may be related to them called plesiorycteropus the most distinctive characteristic of the tubulidentata is as the name implies their teeth which instead of having a pulp cavity have lots of thin tubes of dentine each containing pulp and held together by cementum the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously aardvarks are born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw but these fall out and are not replaced in adult aardvarks the only teeth are the molars at the back of the jaw aardvark aardvarks are only vaguely pig like the body is stout with an arched back the limbs are of moderate length the front feet have lost the pollex or thumb resulting in four toes but the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and shovel like and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof the ears are disproportionately long and the tail very thick at the base with a gradual taper the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and at the end of the snout is a disk in which the nostrils open the mouth is typical of species that feed on termites small and tubular aardvarks have long thin protrusible tongues and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell weight is typically between four zero and six five kg length is usually between one and one three m aardvarks are a pale yellowish gray in color often stained reddish brown by soil the coat is thin and the animal s primary protection is its tough skin aardvarks have been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest so well does it protect them in the past several individual species of aardvark were named however current knowledge indicates that there is only one species orycteropus afer with several subspecies one eight have been listed but most are regarded as invalid aardvarks are nocturnal and solitary creatures that feed almost exclusively on ants and termites an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food when a concentration of ants or termites is found the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongue as many as five zero zero zero zero in one night has been recorded they are exceptionally fast diggers but otherwise move rather slowly aside from digging out ants and termites aardvarks also excavate burrows to live in temporary sites scattered around the home range as refuges and the main burrow which is used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and be one three m long aardvarks change the layout of their home burrow regularly and from time to time move on and make a new one only mothers and young share burrows after a gestation period of seven months a single young weighing around two kg is born and is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks at six months of age it is digging its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season aardvarks can grow older than two zero years in captivity aardvarks are distributed across most of sub saharan africa and although killed by humans both for their flesh and for their teeth which are used as decorations do not appear to be threatened aardvark is always the first noun in the english dictionary more precise information are given in a diploma thesis on the biology of the aardvark which can be downloaded here

sandy clay and straw or other organic materials which is shaped into bricks using wooden frames and dried in the sun also known as mudbrick adobe structures are extremely durable and account for the oldest extant buildings on the planet adobe buildings also offer significant advantages in hot dry climates as they remain cooler as it stores and releases heat very slowly the word adobe is spanish and comes from the arabic at tub the brick and from the coptic tobe the word may be pronounced ah doh beh or uh doh bee buildings made of sun dried earth are common in the middle east north africa and in spain usually in the mudejar style the method of brickmaking was imported to the americas in the one six th century by spaniards a distinction is sometimes made between the smaller adobes which are about the size of ordinary baked bricks and the larger adobines some of which are as much as from one to two yards long in more modern usage the term adobe has come to mean a style of architecture that is popular in the desert climates of north america especially in new mexico cf stucco detail of adobe kilns in arizona composition of adobe an adobe brick is made of soil mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or animal dung the soil composition typically contains clay and sand straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly dung offers the same advantage and is also added to repel insects adobe bricks bricks are made in an open frame two five cm one zero inches by three six cm one four inches is a reasonable size but any convenient size is fine for your own use after the mud is put into the frame the frame is removed after a few hours the bricks are put on edge to finish drying bricks should be dried in the shade to avoid cracking use the same mixture you use to make bricks for mortar when laying the bricks and for plaster on the interior and exterior walls some ancient cultures used concrete for the plaster to avoid rain damage it is sometimes useful to include occasional pieces of wood as you lay a wall to give something to nail insulation onto and stone can be used for additional strength the largest structure ever made from adobe bricks was the bam citadel which suffered serious damage up to eight zero by an earthquake on december two six two zero zero three other large adobe structures are the huaca del sol in peru built using one zero zero million signed bricks and the ciudellas of chan chan also in peru thermal properties because an adobe wall either made of bricks or using a rammed earth technique is quite massive it will hold heat or cold a south facing adobe wall may be left uninsulated in order to collect heat during the day it should be thick enough that it remains cool on the inside during the heat of the day but should be thin enough that the heat can be transferred through the wall by evening such a wall can be covered with glass to increase heat collection used in a passive solar home such a wall is called a trombe wall adobe has a large thermal mass therefore this type of construction is only good in tropical climates in temperate climates it is almost impossible to heat a

of greek mythology see agave mythology agaves are succulent plants of a large botanical genus of the same name belonging to the family agavaceae chiefly mexican they occur also in the southern and western united states and in central and tropical south america the plants have a large rosette of thick fleshy leaves generally ending in a sharp point and with a spiny margin the stout stem is usually short the leaves apparently springing from the root each rosette is monocarpic and grows slowly to flower but once after a number of years when a tall stem or mast grows from the center of the leaf rosette and bears a large number of shortly tubular flowers after development of fruit the original plant dies but suckers are frequently produced from the base of the stem which become new plants swan s neck agave agave attenuata the most familiar species is agave americana a native of tropical america the so called century plant or american aloe the maguey of mexico the name refers to the long time the plant takes to flower although the number of years before flowering occurs depends on the vigor of the individual the richness of the soil and the climate during these years the plant is storing in its fleshy leaves the nourishment required for the effort of flowering during the development of the inflorescence there is a rush of sap to the base of the young flowerstalk in the case of a americana and other species this is used by the mexicans to make their national beverage pulque the flower shoot is cut out and the sap collected and subsequently fermented by distillation a spirit called mezcal is prepared the leaves of several species yield fiber as for instance agave rigida var sisalana sisal hemp agave decipiens false sisal hemp agave americana is the source of pita fiber and is used as a fiber plant in mexico the west indies and southern europe the flowering stem of the last named dried and cut in slices forms natural razor strops and the expressed juice of the leaves will lather in water like soap the native americans of mexico used the agave both to make pens nails and needles as well as string to sew and make weavings in india the plant is extensively used for hedges along railroads agave in bloom in a garden roquevaire bouches du rh ne france september one nine seven eight agave americana century plant was introduced into europe about the middle of the one six th century and is now widely cultivated for its handsome appearance in the variegated forms the leaf has a white or yellow marginal or central stripe from base to apex as the leaves unfold from the center of the rosette the impression of the marginal spines is very conspicuous on the still erect younger leaves the tequ plants are usually grown in tubs and put out in the summer months but in the winter require protection from frost they mature very slowly and die after flowering but are easily propagated by the offsets from the base of the stem agave nectar has been used as an alternative to sugar in cooking the juice from many species of agave can cause acute contact dermatitis it will produce reddening and blistering lasting one to two weeks episodes of itching may recur up to a year thereafter even though there is no longer a visible rash interestingly dried parts of the plants can be handled with bare hands with little or no effect taxonomy agaves were once classified in liliaceae but most references now include them in their own family agavaceae agaves have long presented special difficulties for taxonomy variations within a species may be considerable and a number of named species are of unknown origin and may just be variants of original wild species spanish and portuguese explorers probably brought agaves back with them but really became popular in europe during the one nine th century with many types being imported by collectors some of have been continuously propagated by offset since then and do not

dermatology database information on agave contact dermatitis agavaceae poisonous plants dermatology asia is the largest and most populous region or continent depending on the definition it is traditionally defined as part of the landmass of africa eurasia lying east of the suez canal east of the ural mountains and south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas about six zero of the world s human population lives in asia of whom only two live in the northern and interior half siberia mongolia kazakhstan xinjiang tibet qinghai western uzbekistan and turkmenistan the other nine eight live in the remaining half world map showing asia etymology the word asia entered english via latin from ancient greek asia see also list of traditional greek place names this name is first attested in herodotus c four four zero bc where it refers to asia minor or for the purposes of describing the persian wars to the persian empire as opposed to greece and egypt herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three different women s names are used to describe a single land mass europa asia and libya referring to africa stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus but that the lydians say it was named after asias son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe in sardis even before herodotus homer knew of a trojan ally named asios son of hyrtacus a ruler over several towns and elsewhere he describes a marsh as iliad two four six one the greek term may be derived from assuwa a one four th century bc confederation of states in western anatolia hittite assu good is probably an element in that name alternatively the ultimate etymology of the term may be from the akkadian word w a m cognate of hebrew which means to go out or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the phoenician word asa meaning east this may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for europe as being from semitic er bu to enter or set of the sun however an originally mesopotamian or middle eastern perspective would not explain how the term asia first came to be associated with anatolia as lying west of the semitic speaking area definition and boundaries political map of asia medieval europeans considered asia as a continent a distinct landmass the european concept of the three continents in the old world goes back to classical antiquity with the etymology of the word rooted in the ancient near and middle east the demarcation between asia and africa is the isthmus of suez and the red sea the boundary between asia and europe is commonly believed to run through the dardanelles the sea of marmara the bosporus the black sea the caucasus mountains the caspian sea the ural river to its source and the ural mountains to the kara sea near kara russia however modern discovery of the extent of africa and asia made this definition rather anachronistic especially in the case of asia which would have several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if these criteria were used for example south asia and east asia geologists and physical geographers no longer consider asia and europe to be separate continents it is either defined in terms of geological landmasses physical geography or tectonic plates geology in the former case europe is a western peninsula of eurasia or the africa eurasia landmass in the latter europe and asia are still part of the eurasian plate which excludes the arabian and indian tectonic plates in human geography there are two schools of thought one school follows historical convention and treats europe and asia as different continents categorizing europe east asia the orient south asia british india and the middle east arabia and persia as specific regions for more detailed analysis the other schools equate the word continent in terms of geographical region when referring to europe and use the term region to describe asia in terms of physical geography because in linguistic terms continent implies a distinct landmass it is becoming increasingly common to substitute the term region for continent to avoid the problem of disambiguation altogether there is much confusion in european languages with the term asian because a category implies homogenity the term asian almost always refers to a subcategory of people from asia rather than referring to asian defined in term of asia the fact that in american english asian refers to east asian orientals while in british english asian refers to south asian reflects this confusion sometimes it is not even clear exactly what asia consists of some definitions exclude turkey the middle east and or russia the term is sometimes used more strictly in reference to asia pacific which does not include the middle east or russia but does include islands in the pacific ocean a number of which may also be considered part of australasia and or oceania asia contains the indian subcontinent arabian subcontinent as well as a piece of the north american plate in siberia geographical regions satellite view of asia as already mentioned asia is a subregion of eurasia for further subdivisions based on that term see north eurasia and central eurasia some asian countries stretch beyond asia see bicontinental country for details about the borderline cases between asia and europe asia and africa and asia and oceania the following subregions of asia are traditionally recognized central asia east asia far east north asia south asia or indian subcontinent southeast asia southwest asia or middle east or west asia central asia there is no absolute consensus in the usage of this term usually central asia includes the central asian republics of kazakhstan excluding its small european territory uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and kyrgyzstan afghanistan mongolia and the western regions of china are also sometimes included former soviet states in the caucasus region central asia is currently geopolitically important because international disputes and conflicts over oil pipelines nagorno karabakh and chechnya as well as the presence of u s military and u k military forces in afghanistan east asia this area includes the pacific ocean island countries of taiwan and japan north and south korea on the korean peninsula china but sometimes only the eastern regions sometimes the nations of mongolia and vietnam are also included in east asia more informally southeast asia is included in east asia on some occasions north asia this term is rarely used by geographers but usually it refers to the bigger asian part of russia also known as siberia sometimes the northern parts of other asian nations such as kazakhstan are also included in northern asia south asia or indian subcontinent south asia is also referred to as the indian subcontinent it includes the himalayan states of india pakistan nepal bhutan and bangladesh the indian ocean nations of sri lanka and the maldives india s andaman nicobar and lakshadweep islands also lie in the indian ocean the peninsular india also known as the deccan plateau sometimes afghanistan is also included into this category southeast asia this region contains the malay peninsula indochina and islands in the indian ocean and pacific ocean the countries it contains are in mainland southeast asia the countries myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in maritime southeast asia the countries of malaysia brunei the philippines singapore and indonesia some of the indonesian islands also lie in the melanesia region of oceania east timor also melanesian is sometimes included too the country of malaysia is divided in two by the south china sea and thus has both a mainland and island part southwest asia or middle east near east or west asia this can also be called by the western term middle east which is commonly used by europeans and americans middle east to some interpretations is often used to also refer to some countries in north africa southwest asia can be further divided into anatolia i e asia minor constituting the asian part of turkey the island nation of cyprus in the mediterranean sea the levant or near east which includes syria israel jordan lebanon iraq and the asian portion of egypt the arabian peninsula including saudi arabia united arab emirates bahrain qatar

countries of the pacific rim and has spread more recently to other regions in the late eight zero s and early nine zero s japan s economy was almost as large as that of the rest of the continent combined in one nine nine five japan s economy nearly equalled the usa to tie the largest economy in the world for a day after the japanese currency reached a record high of seven nine yen however since then japan s currency has corrected and china has grown to be the second largest asian economy followed by india in terms of exchange rates it is expected that china will surpass japan in

industry varies from manufacturing cheap goods such as toys to high tech goods such as computers and cars many companies from europe north america and japan have significant operations in the developing asia to take avantage of its abundant supply of cheap labor one of the major employers in manufacturing in asia is the textile industry much of the world s supply of clothing and footwear now originates in southeast asia financial and other services asia has three main financial centers they are in hong kong singapore and tokyo call centers are becoming major employers in india and the

shared many similarities and may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel other innovations such as that of writing seem to have been developed individually in each area cities states and empires developed in these lowlands the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads and from the steppes they could reach all areas of asia the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo europeans who spread their languages into the middle east india and in the tocharians to the borders of china the northernmost part of asia including much of siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests the climate and the tundra these areas remained very sparsely populated the centre and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty while technologically and socially the urban city dwellers were more advanced in many cases they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe however the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in china india and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies population density the following table lists countries and dependencies by population density in inhabitants and km two unlike the figures in the country

terms geography main article geography of aruba aruba is a generally flat riverless island renowned for its white sand beaches most of these are located on the western and southern coasts of the island which are relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents the northern and eastern coasts lacking this protection are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched by humans the interior of the island features some rolling hills the better two of which are called hooiberg at one six five metres five four one ft and mount jamanota which is the highest on the island at one eight eight metres six one seven ft above sea level oranjestad the capital is located at as a separate member state of the kingdom of the netherlands the island state has no administrative subdivisions on the east are cura ao and bonaire two island territories which form the southwest part of the netherlands antilles aruba and these two netherlands antilles islands are also known as the abc islands the local climate is a pleasant tropical marine climate little seasonal temperature variation exists which helps aruba to attract tourists all year round temperatures are

the aruban gross national product is earned with tourism or related activities most of the tourists are from canada the european union and other places notably the united states which is the country s largest trading partner oil processing is the dominant industry in aruba despite expansion of the tourism sector the size of the agriculture and manufacturing industries remains minimal deficit spending has been a staple in aruba s history and modestly high inflation has been present as well although recent efforts at tightening monetary policy may correct this aruba receives some

island as a source of meat for other dutch possessions in the caribbean the arawak heritage is stronger on aruba than on most caribbean islands no full blooded indians remain but the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic heritage the majority of the population is descended from arawak dutch and spanish ancestors recently there has been substantial immigration to the island from

commonly known as the articles of confederation was the first governing document of the united states of america the articles which combined the one three colonies of the american revolutionary war into a loose confederation were adopted by the second continental congress on november one five one seven seven seven after one six months of debate the articles were ratified three years later on march one one seven eight one the articles were eventually replaced by the united states constitution on june two one one seven eight eight when the ninth state new hampshire ratified the constitution according to their own terms for modification however the articles were still in effect until one seven nine zero when every one of the one three states had ratified the new constitution ratification the articles of confederation were submitted to the states for ratification on november one seven one seven seven seven accompanied by a letter from congress urging that the document be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength to maintain and defend our common liberties the document only became effective as it was ratified by the states this process dragged on for several years stalled by an interstate quarrel over claims to uncolonized land in the west maryland was the last hold out it refused to ratify until virginia and new york agreed to rescind their claims to lands in the ohio river valley all of the colonies rebelling against britain ratified it by one seven eight one although congress debated the articles for over a year it requested immediate action on the part of the states on february five one seven seven eight south carolina became the first state to ratify the articles of confederation however three and a half years passed before the final ratification by maryland on march one one seven eight one article summaries even though the articles of confederation and the constitution were established by much of the same people they were still very different the document contained one three articles a conclusion and a signatory section establishes the name of the confederation as the united states of america explains the rights possessed by any state and the amount of power to which any state is entitled establishes the united states as a league of states united for their common defense the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them establishes freedom of movement anyone can pass freely between states excluding paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted all people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he or she travels if a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed allocates one vote in the congress of the confederation united states in congress assembled to each state which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members members of congress were appointed by state legislatures individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years limits the powers of states to conduct foreign relations and to declare war when an army is raised for common defense colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures expenditures by the united states will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each defines the rights of the central government to declare war to set weights and measures including coins and for congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states defines a committee of the states to be a government when congress is not in session requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy preapproves canada if they apply for membership reaffirms that the confederation accepts war debt incurred by congress before the articles assumption declares that the articles are perpetual and can only be altered by approval of congress with ratification by all the state legislatures still at war with the kingdom of great britain the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government jealously guarding their new independence the continental congress created a loosely structured unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states at the expense of the confederation while calling on congress to regulate military and monetary affairs for example the articles of confederation provided no mechanism to ensure states complied with requests for troops or revenue at times this left the military in a precarious position as george washington wrote in a one seven eight one letter to the governor of massachusetts john hancock the end of the war the treaty of paris one seven eight three ending hostilities with great britain languished in congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature yet congress had no power to enforce attendance writing to george clinton in september one seven eight three george washington complained congress have come to no determination yet respecting the peace establishment nor am i able to say when they will i have lately had a conference with a committee on this subject and have reiterated my former opinions but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss great national points function the articles supported the congressional direction of the continental army and allowed the thirteen colonies to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers but as an instrument of government they were largely a failure congress could make decisions but had no power to enforce them perhaps the most important power that congress was denied was the power of taxation congress could only request money from the states understandably the states did not generally comply with the requests in full leaving the confederation chronically short of funds the states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war and paying congressional debts became a major issue nevertheless the continental congress did take two actions with lasting impact the land ordinance of one seven eight five established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later american expansion the northwest ordinance of one seven eight seven noted the agreement of the original states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states once the unity demanded by the revolutionary war became unnecessary the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against indian attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and one one of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in one seven eight three washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced the congress to leave philadelphia on june two one revision in may one seven eight six charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus in september five states assembled in the annapolis convention one seven eight six to discuss adjustments that would improve commerce under their chairman alexander hamilton they invited state representatives to convene in philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government after debate congress endorsed the plan to revise the articles of confederation on february two one one seven eight seven according to some historians the articles were flawed in particular the confederal government was unable to settle state disputes on issues like trade and had no power to tax directly after all the states were thirteen individual republics it took radical action to strip them of that sovereignty lessons although ultimately replaced by the united states constitution the articles of confederation provided stability during the american revolutionary war years most importantly the experience of drafting and living under this initial document provided valuable lessons in self governance and somewhat tempered fears about a powerful central government still reconciling the turmoil between state and federal authority continues to challenge america as seen in such conflicts as the one eight three two nullification crisis the american civil war one eight six one six five post civil war reconstruction and the supreme court s landmark brown v board of education decision in one nine five four signatures the copy of the articles in the u s national archives has a series of signatures on page six a list of them is presented here the signing of the articles was a process that has caused some confusion the articles were approved for distribution to the states on november one five one seven seven seven a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned and a cover letter had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson who were the president and secretary to the congress but the articles at that time were unsigned and the date was blank congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june two seven one seven seven eight they ordered a final copy prepared the one in the national archives and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification then on july nine one seven seven eight the prepared copy was ready they dated it and began to sign they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed on that date delegates present from new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york pennsylvania virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified new jersey delaware and maryland could not since their states had not ratified north carolina and georgia also didn t sign that day since their delegations were absent after the first signing some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended for example john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august eight john penn was the first of north carolina s delegates to arrive on july one zero and the delegation signed the articles on july two one one seven seven eight the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation georgia signed on july two four new jersey on november two six and delaware on february one two one seven seven nine after a wait of two years maryland ratified and her delegates signed the articles on march one one seven eight one the articles were finally in force congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates and some of the signers had only recently arrived the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time the signers and the states they represented were new hampshire josiah bartlett

sedgwick march two two one seven eight five january two seven one eight seven three was one of the founders of modern geology he proposed the devonian period of the geological timescale and later the cambrian period the latter proposal was based on work which he did on welsh rock strata sedgwick was born in dent at that time in yorkshire the third child of an anglican vicar he was educated at sedbergh school and trinity college cambridge introduction in one eight one seven he took holy orders and in one eight one eight he became woodwardian professor of geology at the university of cambridge department of earth sciences holding a chair that had been endowed ninety years before by the natural historian john woodward he lacked formal training in geology but he quickly became an active researcher in geology and paleontology during his tenure he immensely enlarged the geological collections of cambridge university and carried out important field research all over great britain sedgwick is said to have remarked upon being appointed woodwardian professor hitherto i have never turned a stone henceforth i will leave no stone unturned in one eight two two he carried out fieldwork unraveling the complex geology of the lake district of northern england armed with the new discoveries and techniques of william smith he met and befriended the poet william wordsworth on this expedition and also met the poet robert southey and the chemist john dalton his lectures at cambridge were immensely popular he was a spellbinding lecturer and breaking with the traditions of his time his lectures were open to women whom sedgwick thought could make great contributions to natural history he continued to rise in his profession in one eight two nine he became president of the geological society of london and in one eight four five a vice master of trinity college as vice master he led campaigns to open cambridge to non anglicans and to reorganize the academic programs in the process meeting and becoming close to queen victoria and her consort prince albert by the one eight five zero s he was in poor health cared for by his niece isabella still he kept giving his famous lectures until one eight seven one early work sedgwick was one of several great figures in what has been called the heroic age of geology the time when the great geological time periods were defined and when much exploration and fundamental research was carried out sedgwick s work placed him at the epicenter of one of the most heated geological controversies of his day stemming from his work with the gentleman geologist roderick murchison they explored the geology of scotland in one eight two seven and in one eight three nine they jointly presented their researches on certain rocks in devon england which had a distinctive fossil assemblage that led them to propose a new division of the geological time scale the devonian in the early one eight three zero s both men were working on the rocks of wales which were and are very difficult to work on due to extensive folding and faulting however they seemed to be older than most of the sedimentary rocks farther east murchison documented the presence of a distinctive set of fossils one in which very few fish were found but that included numerous different types of trilobites brachiopods and other such fossils murchison named the system of rocks containing such fossils the silurian after the silures a celtic tribe living in the welsh borderlands at the time of the romans sedgwick who had been working in central wales proposed the existence of a separate system below the silurian which he named the cambrian after cambria the latin name for wales the two presented a joint paper in one eight three five entitled on the silurian and cambrian systems exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in england and wales sedgwick s upper cambrian overlapped with the lower part of murchison s silurian sedgwick had defined his cambrian using physical characters of the rocks which were unique to wales and had not relied extensively on fossils which could be found everywhere murchison who had used fossils extensively in defining the silurian claimed at first that the upper cambrian and then the entire cambrian were really parts of the silurian the resulting quarrel between the two men left them permanently estranged and took years to resolve there was more than a simple matter of names involved both geologists wanted the honour of describing the rocks that recorded the beginning of life on earth for no fossils were known that were older than those of the cambrian murchison felt that the fossils of sedgwick s cambrian were not different enough from his silurian forms to merit the naming of a geologic time period and it was some time before truly distinctive cambrian fossils were documented today following the solution worked out in one eight seven nine by sedgwick s colleague charles lapworth geologists use both time periods with a third one the ordovician also named for a celtic tribe in wales between the cambrian and the silurian equivalent to the disputed upper cambrian lower silurian beds each one of these is now known to be characterized by distinct fossil assemblages disagreement with darwin for one summer of his work in wales which was to lead to this controversy sedgwick made a fateful choice of field assistant a young cambridge graduate named charles darwin darwin had passed his examinations for the bachelor of arts degree in january one eight three one and began attending sedgwick s geology lectures which he found fascinating that summer the two men explored the rocks of north wales darwin got a crash course in field geology from sedgwick an experience that would stand him in good stead over the next five years on the round the world voyage of hms beagle during this voyage darwin sent rocks and fossils from south america back to sedgwick as well as descriptions of the geology of south america these impressed sedgwick who wrote in a letter to darwin s family he is doing admirably in s america he was inducted into the society shortly after his return the two stayed friends until sedgwick s death but sedgwick was upset and disappointed by darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection after reading the origin of species sedgwick candidly wrote to darwin on november two four one eight five nine if i did not think you a good tempered parts i laughed at till my sides were almost sore other parts i read with absolute sorrow because i think them utterly false however despite this difference of opinion the two men remained friendly until sedgwick s death flawed opinions sedgwick s own geological views were generally catastrophic he believed that the history of the earth had been marked by a series of cataclysmic events which had destroyed much of the earth s life in this belief he followed cuvier and he was opposed to charles lyell s models of slow gradual geological change and a more or less steady state earth however sedgwick was interested in the possibility that at least some of the catastrophic changes implied by the rock record might be shown to be gradual he originally followed his colleague william buckland in believing that the uppermost pleistocene deposits had been laid down by the biblical flood but retracted this belief after many of these deposits turned out to have been formed by glaciers not floods sedgwick also did not object to evolution or development as such theories were called then in the broad sense to the fact that the life on earth had changed over time nor was he a young earth creationist he believed that the earth must be extremely old as darwin wrote of sedgwick s lectures what a capital hand is sedgewick sic for drawing large cheques upon the bank of time however sedgwick believed in the divine creation of life over long periods of time by a power i cannot imitate or comprehend but in which i believe by a legitimate conclusion of sound reason drawn from the laws of harmonies of nature what sedgwick objected to was the apparent amoral and materialist nature of darwin s proposed mechanism natural selection which he thought degrading to humanity s spiritual aspirations his letter of november two four went on to state this view of nature you have stated admirably tho admitted by all naturalists but how came it about here in language if i do not mistake your meaning you have done your best in one or two pregnant cases to break it were it possible which thank god it is not to break it humanity in my mind would suffer a damage that might brutalize it sink the human race into a lower grade of degradation than any into which it

have produced the first hebrew language crossword puzzles women koestler was married to dorothy asher one nine three five five zero mamaine paget one nine five zero five two and cynthia jefferies one nine six five eight three he also had a very short fling with the french writer simone de beauvoir one that may explain the mutual animosity between him and jean paul sartre david cesarani claimed that koestler beat and raped several women including film director jill craigie the resulting protests led to the removal of a bust of koestler from public display at the university of edinburgh questions have also been raised by his suicide pact with his last spouse although he was terminally ill at the time she was apparently healthy leading some to claim he wrongly persuaded her to take her own life mixed legacy just as darkness at noon was selling well during the cold war of the four zero s and five zero s koestler announced his retirement from politics much of what he wrote thereafter revealed a multidisciplinary thinker whose work anticipated a number of trends by many years he was among the first to experiment with lsd in a laboratory he also wrote about japanese and indian mysticism in the lotus and the robot one nine six zero he did not merely arrive at different answers to accepted questions rather he tended to ask questions that no one else thought to ask this originality resulted in an uneven set of ideas and conclusions some of them such as his work on creativity insight and outlook act of creation and the history of science the sleepwalkers are arguably brilliant and challenge us to readjust our thinking some of his other pursuits such as his interest in the paranormal his support for euthanasia his theory of the origin of ashkenazi jews like himself and his disagreement with darwinism are more controversial politics koestler was involved in a number of political causes during his life from zionism and communism to anti communism voluntary euthanasia and campaigns against capital punishment particularly hanging he was also an early advocate of nuclear disarmament journalism until the bestseller status of darkness at noon made him financially comfortable koestler often earned his living as a journalist and foreign correspondent trading on his ability to write quickly in several languages and to acquire with facility a working knowledge of a new language he wrote for a variety of newspapers including vossische zeitung science editor and b z am mittag foreign editor in the one nine two zero s in the early one nine three zero s he worked for the ullstein publishing group in berlin and did freelance writing for the french press while covering the spanish civil war in one nine three seven he was captured and held for several months by the falangists in m laga until the british foreign office negotiated his release his spanish testament records these experiences which he soon transformed into his classic prison novel darkness at noon after his release from spanish detention koestler worked for the news chronicle then edited die zukunft with willi m nzenberg an anti nazi anti stalinist german language paper based in paris founded in one nine three eight during and after wwii he wrote for a number of english and american papers including the sunday telegraph on various subjects science during the last three zero years of his life koestler wrote extensively on science and scientific practice the post modernist scepticism colouring much of this writing tended to alienate most of the scientific community a case in point is his one nine seven one book the case of the midwife toad about the biologist paul kammerer who claimed to find experimental support for lamarckian inheritance mysticism and a fascination with the paranormal imbued much of his later work and greatly influenced his personal life he left a substantial part of his estate to establish the koestler institute at the university of edinburgh dedicated to the study of paranormal phenomena his the roots of coincidence centered on yet another line of unconventional research by paul kammerer this time his claim of a quantum theory of coincidence or synchronicity a theory koestler evaluated in light of the writings of carl jung more controversial were koestler s studies of levitation and telepathy judaism although a lifelong atheist koestler s ancestry was jewish his biographer david cesarani has claimed that koestler deliberately disowned his jewish ancestry koestler s book the thirteenth tribe advanced the controversial thesis that ashkenazi jews are not descended from the israelites of antiquity but from the khazars a turkic people in the caucasus who converted to judaism in the eight th century and were later forced to move westwards into current russia ukraine and poland koestler stated that part of his intent in writing the thirteenth tribe was to defuse anti semitism by undermining the identification of european jews with biblical jews with the hope of rendering anti semitic epithets such as christ killer inapplicable ironically koestler s thesis that ashkenazi jews are not semitic has become an important claim of many anti semitic groups some palestinians have eagerly seized upon this thesis believing that to identify most jews as non semites seriously undermines their historical claim to the land of israel the thesis of the thirteenth tribe has since been criticized to date the genetic evidence has been inconclusive some researchers claim to find a middle eastern genetic element in virtually all ashkenazim others note both turkic words and turkic genetic markers in these populations but the usefulness of genetic markers in determining ancestry can be problematic for instance ashkenazim also display a high level of similarity to the genetic markers of khoisan bushmen in southern africa a thorough review of the scientific literature can be found at khazaria com when koestler resided in palestine during the one nine two zero s he lived on a kibbutz an experience forming the basis of his unfinished thieves in the night his view of israel was that it would never be destroyed short of a second shoah he supported the statehood of israel but opposed a diaspora jewish culture in an interview published in the london jewish chronicle around the time of israel s founding koestler asserted that all jews should either migrate to israel or assimilate completely into their local cultures koestler was also no dogmatic zionist for instance he proposed that israel drop the hebrew alphabet for the roman cultural influence in his younger days the singer sting was an avid reader of koestler his band of the time the police were to name one of their albums ghost in the machine after one of koestler s books the title synchronicity was also inspired by koestler s the roots of coincidence which mentions carl jung s theory of the same name koestler knew little about the burgeoning new wave music scene and is alleged to have said look at this did you ever see a magazine called the new musical express it turns out there is a pop group called the police i don t know why they are called that presumably to distinguish them from the punks and they ve made an album of my essay the ghost in the machine i didn t know anything about it until my clipping agency sent me a review of the record the cyberpunk manga and anime series ghost in the shell was also inspired by koestler s the ghost in the machine bibliography an excellent introduction to koestler s writing and

ocean s name derived from greek mythology means the sea of atlas this ocean occupies an elongated s shaped basin extending in a north south direction and is divided into the north atlantic and south atlantic by equatorial counter currents at about eight north latitude bounded by the americas on the west and europe and africa on the east the atlantic is linked to the pacific ocean by the arctic ocean on the north and the drake passage on the south an artificial connection between the atlantic and pacific is also provided by the panama canal on the east the dividing line between the atlantic and the indian ocean is the two zero east meridian running south from cape agulhas to antarctica the atlantic is separated from the arctic ocean by a line from greenland to northwestern iceland and then from northeastern iceland to southernmost tip of spitsbergen and then to north cape in northern norway the atlantic ocean as seen from the west coast of ireland on a fair day covering approximately two zero of earth s surface the atlantic ocean is second only to the pacific in size with its adjacent seas it occupies an area of about one zero six four zero zero zero zero zero square

bermuda the west indies ascension st helena trindade martin vaz tristan da cunha the falkland islands and south georgia island atlantic ocean ocean bottom the principal feature of the bottom topography of the atlantic ocean is a great submarine mountain range called the mid atlantic ridge it extends from iceland in the north to approximately five eight south latitude reaching a maximum width of about one six zero zero kilometres one zero zero zero mi a great rift valley also extends along the ridge over most of its length the depth of water over the ridge is less than two seven zero zero metres eight nine zero zero ft in most places and several mountain peaks rise above the water forming islands the south atlantic ocean has an additional submarine ridge the walvis ridge the mid atlantic ridge separates the atlantic ocean into two large troughs with depths averaging between three seven zero zero and five five zero zero metres one two zero zero zero and one eight zero zero zero ft transverse ridges running between the continents and the mid atlantic ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins some of the larger basins are the guiana north american cape verde and canaries basins in the north atlantic the largest south atlantic basins are the angola cape argentina and brazil basins the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat although numerous seamounts and some guyots exist several deeps or trenches are also found on the ocean floor the puerto rico trench in the north atlantic is the deepest the laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada in the south atlantic the south sandwich trench reaches a depth of eight four two eight metres two seven six five one ft a third major trench the romanche trench is located near the equator and reaches a depth of about seven four five four metres two four four five five ft the shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about one one of the bottom topography in addition a number of deep channels cut across the continental rise ocean sediments are composed of terrigenous pelagic and authigenic material terrigenous deposits consist of sand mud and rock particles formed by erosion weathering and volcanic activity on land and then washed to sea these materials are largely found on the continental shelves and are thickest off the mouths of large rivers or off desert coasts pelagic deposits which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor include red clays and globigerina pteropod and siliceous oozes covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from six zero metres to three three zero zero metres two zero zero ft to one one zero zero zero ft they are thickest in the convergence belts and in the zones of upwelling authigenic deposits consist of such materials as manganese nodules they occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits water characteristics the salinity of the surface waters in the open ocean ranges from three three to three seven parts per thousand by mass and varies with latitude and season although the minimum salinity values are found just north of the equator in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers flow into the ocean maximum salinity values occur at about two five north latitude surface salinity values are influenced by evaporation precipitation river inflow and melting of sea ice surface water temperatures which vary with latitude current systems and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy range from less than two c to two nine c two eight f to eight four f maximum temperatures occur north of the equator and minimum values are found in the polar regions in the middle latitudes the area of maximum temperature variations values may vary by seven c to eight c one three f to one five f the atlantic ocean consists of four major water masses the north and south atlantic central waters constitute the surface waters the sub antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of one zero zero zero metres three three zero zero ft the north atlantic deep water reaches depths of as much as four zero zero zero metres one three two zero zero ft the antarctic bottom water occupies ocean basins at depths greater than four zero zero zero metres one three two zero zero ft within the north atlantic ocean currents isolate a large elongated body of water known as the sargasso sea in which the salinity is noticeably higher than average the sargasso sea contains large amounts of seaweed and is also the spawning ground for the european eel due to the coriolis effect water in the north atlantic circulates in a clockwise direction whereas water circulation in the south atlantic is counter clockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi diurnal that is two high tides occur during each two four lunar hours the tides are a general wave that moves from south to north in latitudes above four zero north some east west oscillation occurs climate waves in the trade winds in the atlantic ocean areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes the climate of the atlantic ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters because of the oceans great capacity for retaining heat maritime climates are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from the water temperatures the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation climatic zones vary with latitude the warmest climatic zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator the coldest zones are in the high latitudes with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice ocean currents contribute to climatic control by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions adjacent land areas are affected by the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents the gulf stream for example warms the atmosphere of the british isles and northwestern europe and the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of northeastern canada the grand banks area and the northwestern coast of africa in general winds tend to transport moisture and warm or cool air over land areas hurricanes develop in the southern part of the north atlantic ocean history and economy the atlantic ocean appears to be the second youngest of the world s oceans after the southern ocean evidence indicates that it did not exist prior to one eight zero million years ago when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral supercontinent pangaea were being rafted apart by the process of seafloor spreading the atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements were established along its shores the vikings portuguese and christopher columbus were the most famous among its early explorers after columbus european exploration rapidly accelerated and many new trade routes were established as a result the atlantic became and remains the major artery between europe and the americas known as transatlantic trade numerous scientific explorations have been undertaken including those by the german meteor expedition columbia university s lamont geological observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office the ocean has also contributed significantly to the development and economy of the countries around it besides its major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves and the world s richest fishing resources especially in the waters covering the shelves the major species of fish caught are cod haddock hake herring and mackerel the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the shelf area off nova scotia georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks eel lobster and whales have also been taken in great quantities all these factors taken together tremendously enhance the atlantic s great commercial value because of the threats to the ocean environment presented by oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea various international treaties exist to reduce some forms of pollution in one eight five eight the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid by cyrus field in one nine one nine the

february two two one seven eight eight september two one one eight six zero was a german philosopher he is most famous for his work the world as will and representation he is commonly known for having espoused a sort of philosophical pessimism that saw life as being essentially evil futile and full of suffering however upon closer inspection in accordance with eastern thought especially that of hinduism and buddhism he saw salvation deliverance or escape from suffering in aesthetic contemplation sympathy for others and ascetic living his ideas profoundly influenced the fields of philosophy psychology music and literature life schopenhauer was born in one seven eight eight in sztutowo poland near gda sk he was the son of heinrich floris schopenhauer and johanna schopenhauer a middle class mercantile family of dutch heritage although they had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism indeed the name arthur was selected by his father especially because it was the same in english german and french his parents were both from the city and johanna was an author as well after the city was annexed by prussia during the second partition of poland in one seven nine three the schopenhauer family fled to hamburg in one eight zero five schopenhauer s father died possibly by suicide and johanna moved to weimar because of a promise to pursue a business career schopenhauer remained in hamburg his disgust of this career however drove him away to join his mother in weimar after only a year he never got along with his mother when the writer goethe who was a friend of johanna schopenhauer told her that he thought her son was destined for great things johanna objected she had never heard there could be two geniuses in a single family schopenhauer studied at the university of g ttingen and was awarded a phd from the university of jena in one eight two zero schopenhauer became a lecturer at the university of berlin it was there that his opposition to hegel began while in berlin schopenhauer became involved in a consuming lawsuit from a caroline marquet she asked for damages from him a man of independent means on the basis that she had been injured when schopenhauer allegedly pushed her marquet had noisily attracted schopenhauer s attention then marquet s companion witnessed her as being prostrate outside of his apartment marquet claimed that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway in this manner she succeeded in gaining through the court a portion of schopenhauer s limited wealth he had to make payments for many years his reputation was permanently damaged by her legal machination schopenhauer s health deteriorated during the year of one eight six zero he died of natural causes on september two one of the same year at the age of seven two schopenhauer called himself a kantian and despised hegel he formulated a pessimistic philosophy that gained importance and support after the failure of the german and austrian revolutions of one eight four eight philosophy schopenhauer s starting point was kant s division of the universe into phenomenon and noumenon claiming that the noumenon was the same as that in us which we call will it is the inner content and the driving force of the world for schopenhauer human will had ontological primacy over the intellect in other words desire is understood to be prior to thought and in a parallel sense will is said to be prior to being in solving alleviating the fundamental problems of life schopenhauer was rare among philosophers in considering philosophy and logic less important or less effective than art certain types of charitable practice loving kindness in his terms and certain forms of religious discipline schopenhauer concluded that discursive thought such as philosophy and logic could neither touch nor transcend the nature of desire i e the will in the world as will and representation schopenhauer posited that humans living in the realm of objects are living in the realm of desire and thus are eternally tormented by that desire his idea of the role of desire in life is similar to that of vedanta hinduism and buddhism and schopenhauer draws attention to these similarities himself while schopenhauer s philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental schopenhauer s identification of the kantian noumenon i e the actually existing entity with what we call our will deserves some explanation the noumenon was what kant called the ding an sich the thing in itself the reality that is the foundation of our sensory and mental representations of an external world in kantian terms those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena schopenhauer s assertion that what we call our will is the same as this noumenon might at first instance strike some as oddly as heraclitus s revelation that everything is made out of fire but kant s philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical philosophical skepticism of david hume and his fellow british empiricists who claimed that as far as we could tell there was no outside reality beyond our mental representations of it schopenhauer begins by arguing that kant s demarcation between external objects knowable only as phenomena and the thing in itself of noumenon contains a significant omission there is in fact one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception it is our own body we know our human bodies have boundaries and occupy space the same way other objects known only through our named senses do though we seldom think of our bodies as physical objects we know even before reflection that it shares some of their properties we understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own bodies we would obtain similar results we know this even if we do not understand the physics involved we know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body most of us possess the power of voluntary motion we usually are not aware of our lungs breath or our heartbeat unless our attention is called to it our ability to control either is limited our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose few of us have any idea what our livers are doing right now though this organ is as needful as lungs heart or kidneys the conscious mind is the servant not the master of these and other organs these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose and has limited power over when schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires needs and impulses in us that we name will what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will we cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning through will we know without thinking that the world can stimulate us we suffer fear or desire these states arise involuntarily they arise prior to reflection they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay the rational mind is for schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre reflective and largely unconscious emotion that stream is will and through will if not through logic we can participate in the underlying reality that lies beyond mere phenomena it is for this reason that schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will also schopenhauer s philosophy could be considered as panpsychism and solipsism and in some way gnostic psychology schopenhauer was perhaps even more influential in his treatment of man s mind than he was in the realm of philosophy philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of love but schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly we should be surprised that a matter that generally plays such an important part in the life of man love has hitherto been almost entirely disregarded by philosophers and lies before us as raw and untreated material he gave a name to a force within man which he felt invariably had precedence over reason the will to live wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and indeed all creatures to stay alive and to reproduce schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental but rather understood it to be an immensely powerful force lying unseen within man s psyche and dramatically shaping the world the ultimate aim of all love affairs is more important than all other aims in man s life and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation these ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for darwin s theory of evolution nietzsche s will to power and freud s concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind aesthetics see main article schopenhauer s aesthetics this wild and powerful drive to reproduce however caused suffering and pain in the world for schopenhauer one way to escape the suffering inherent in a world of will was through art through art schopenhauer thought the thinking subject could be jarred out of their limited individual perspective to feel a sense of the universal metaphysics directly the universal in question of course was the will the contest of personal desire with a world that was by nature inimical to its satisfaction is inevitably tragical therefore the highest place in art was given to tragedy music was also given a special status in schopenhauer s aesthetics as it did not rely upon the medium of representation to communicate a sense of the universal schopenhauer believed the function of art to be a meditation on the unity of human nature and an attempt to either demonstrate or directly communicate to the audience a certain existential angst for which most forms of entertainment including bad art only provided a distraction a wide range of authors from thomas hardy to woody allen and artists have been influenced by this system of aesthetics and in the two zero th century this area of schopenhauer s work garnered more attention and praise than any other according to daniel albright two zero zero five schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself politics schopenhauer s politics were for the most part a much diminished echo of his system of ethics the latter being expressed in die beiden grundprobleme der ethik available in english as two separate books on the basis of morality and on the freedom of the will ethics also occupies about one fourth of his central work the world as will and representation in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralimpomena and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government what was essential he thought was that the state should leave each man free to work out his own salvation and so long as government was thus limited he would prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of his fellow rats i e a monarch schopenhauer did however share the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and of state violence to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species schopenhauer by his own admission did not give much thought to politics and several times he writes prideful boasts of how little attention he had paid to political affairs of his day in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and a few continent shaking wars he did indeed maintain his aloof position of minding not the times but the eternities schopenhauer on women schopenhauer is also famous for his essay on women ber die weiber in which he expressed his opposition to what he called teutonico christian stupidity on female affairs he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey and opposed schiller s poem in honor of women w rde der frauen the essay does give two compliments however that women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others however the latter was discounted as weakness rather than humanitarian virtue the ultra intolerant view of women contrasts with schopenhauer s generally liberal views on other social issues he was strongly against taboos on issues like suicide and masochism and condemned the treatment of african slaves this polemic on female nature has since been fiercely attacked as misogynistic however he did not hold a universally negative opinion of women in particular one should note that schopenhauer had a very high opinion of madame de guyon whose writings and biography he highly recommended in any case the controversial writing has influenced many from nietzsche to one nine th century feminists while schopenhauer s hostility to women may tell us more about his biography than about philosophy his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists in the twentieth century schopenhauer on homosexuality schopenhauer was also one of the first philosophers since the days of greek philosophy to address the subject of male homosexuality in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation one eight five six schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love in it he develops the idea that since only mature men and fully adult but pre menopausal women are capable of bearing healthy children in early adolescence and in late middle age the sexual appetite is susceptible of being turned towards another channel while there may again be more autobiography than analysis in this hypothesis it is consistent with the general tenor of schopenhauer s thought which gives the will in nature the position of setting an agenda for individual lives it is also one of the first attempts at portraying homosexuality as a natural phenomenon acknowledging its existence in every culture and seeking to explain its appearance even in those cultures whose moralities sharply condemn homosexual behaviour schopenhauer on hegel schopenhauer seems to have disliked just about everything concerning his contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel the following quotation from on the basis of morality page one five one six is quite famous but schopenhauer had good reason to mistrust the writings of hegel in his foreword to the first edition of his work die beiden grundprobleme der ethik schopenhauer had found hegel to have fallen prey to the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy schopenhauer s critique of hegel is most certainly directed at his perception that hegel s works use deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous jargon and neologisms and that they contained castles of abstraction that sounded impressive but ultimately contained no verifiable content he also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with search for philosophical truth although schopenhauer may have appeared vain in his constant attacks on hegel they were not necessarily devoid of merit the right hegelians interpreted hegel as seeing the prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then common misconceptions many are put off schopenhauer by descriptions of him as an obstinate and arrogant man who did not lead the ascetic life that he glorified in his work the idea that he made resignation into a command to virtue is inaccurate as he was merely trying to explain asceticism in terms of metaphysics he does refer to the asceticism as a state of inner peace and cheerfulness but he also clearly states that he was not trying to recommend the denial of the will above the affirmation of the will furthermore the call to asceticism was supposed to come to select individuals as knowledge all of a sudden rather than being a virtue that can be taught in general he wrote it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses the world as will and representation vol i six eight nietzsche seems to have made this misinterpretation leading some people to a distorted view of schopenhauer the following sentence from the twilight of the idols is often quoted schopenhauer did see all these things as means to a more peaceful and enlightened way of life but none of them were denial of the will to live only asceticism is referred to in that way nietzsche also claimed that schopenhauer did not recognise that suffering had a redemptive quality yet his recognition of this seems blatantly clear in part four of the world as will and representation also his identification of the will with the kantian thing in itself has been misunderstood kant defined things in themselves as being beyond comprehension and that no one could know the inner nature of a material thing it is sometimes thought that schopenhauer denied this but he did not what he did assert was that one could know things about the thing in itself for example you can know that the will is a striving force that it is endless that it causes suffering that it will produce boredom if unoccupied etc however he did not say that you could directly know the will in addition it has sometimes been criticised that he never defined the will but he explained that it could not be fully defined influence schopenhauer is thought to have influenced the following intellectual figures and schools of thought

geology the rock formations of angola are met with in three distinct regions the littoral zone the median zone formed by a series of hills more or less parallel with the coast the central plateau the central plateau consists of ancient crystalline rocks with granites overlain by unfossiliferous sandstones and conglomerates of paleozoic age the outcrops are largely hidden under laterite the median zone is composed largely of crystalline rocks with granites and some palaeozoic unfossiliferous rocks the littoral zone contains the only fossiliferous strata these are of tertiary and cretaceous ages the latter rocks resting on a reddish sandstone of older date the cretaceous rocks of the dombe grande region near benguella are of albian age and belong to the acanthoceras mamillari zone the beds containing schloenbachia inflata are referable to the gault rocks of tertiary age are met with at dombe grande mossamedes and near loanda the sandstones with gypsum copper and sulfur of dombe are doubtfully considered to be of triassic age recent eruptive rocks mainly basalts form a line of hills almost bare of vegetation between benguella and mossamedes nepheline basalts and liparites occur

lowland characterized by low plains and terraces hills and mountains rising inland from the coast into a great escarpment and an area of high plains called the high plateau planalto which extends eastward from the escarpment the highest point in angola is morro de moco at two six two zero m coastal lowland the coastal lowland rises from the sea in a series of low terraces this region varies in width from about two five kilometers near benguela to more than one five zero kilometers in the cuanza river valley just south of angola s capital luanda and is markedly different from angola s highland mass the atlantic ocean s cold northwardflowing benguela current substantially reduces precipitation along the coast making the region relatively arid or nearly so south of benguela where it forms the northern extension of the namib desert and quite dry even in its northern reaches even where as around luanda the average annual rainfall may be as much as fifty centimeters it is not uncommon for the rains to fail given this pattern of precipitation the far south is marked by sand dunes which give way to dry scrub along the middle coast portions of the northern coastal plain are covered by thick brush hills and mountains the belt of hills and mountains parallels the coast at distances ranging from two zero kilometers to one zero zero kilometers inland the cuanza river divides the zone into two parts the northern part rises gradually from the coastal zone to an average elevation of five zero zero meters with crests as high as one zero zero zero meters to one eight zero zero meters south of the cuanza river the hills rise sharply from the coastal lowlands and form a high escarpment extending from a point east of luanda and running south through namibia the escarpment reaches two four zero zero meters at its highest point southeast of the town of sumbe and is steepest in the far south in the serra da chela mountain range high plateau the high plateau lies to the east of the hills and mountains and dominates angola s terrain the surface of the plateau is typically flat or rolling but parts of the benguela plateau and the humpata highland area of the hu la plateau in the south reach heights of two five zero zero meters and more the malanje plateau to the north rarely exceeds one zero zero zero meters in height the benguela plateau and the coastal area in the immediate environs of benguela and lobito the bi plateau the malanje plateau and a small section of the hu la plateau near the town of lubango have long been among the most densely settled areas in angola drainage most of the country s many rivers originate in central angola but their patterns of flow are diverse and their ultimate outlets varied a number of rivers flow in a more or less westerly course to the atlantic ocean providing water for irrigation in the dry coastal strip and the potential for hydroelectric power only some of which had been realized by one nine eight eight two of angola s most important rivers the cuanza and the cunene take a more indirect route to the atlantic the cuanza flowing north and the cunene flowing south before turning west the cuanza is the only river wholly within angola that is navigable for nearly two zero zero kilometers from its mouth by boats of commercially or militarily significant size the congo river whose mouth and western end form a small portion of angola s northern border with zaire is also navigable north of the lunda divide a number of important tributaries of the congo river flow north to join it draining angola s northeast quadrant south of the divide some rivers flow into the zambezi river and thence to the indian ocean others to the okavango river as the cubango river is called along the border with namibia

leading one of those charges he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee he did not think the wound serious at the time and sent his personal physician to attend to some wounded union soldiers instead the bullet had in fact clipped his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood within a few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting off of his horse and asked him if he was wounded to which he replied yes and i fear seriously it is possible that johnston s duel in one eight three seven had caused nerve damage or numbness to that leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result johnston was taken to a small ravine where he bled to death in minutes ironically it is probable that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round no union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind johnston during the fatal charge while it is known that many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers he was the highest ranking casualty of the war and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy jefferson davis considered him the best general in the country this was

four five zero zero m one three zero zero zero and one five zero zero zero ft deep and the north american or hyperborean basin which is about four zero zero zero m deep the topography of the ocean bottom is marked by fault block ridges plains of the abyssal zone ocean deeps and basins the average depth of the arctic ocean is one zero three eight m three four zero seven ft in part due to the large extent of continental shelf extant on the eurasian side the arctic ocean is used by both marine mammals and nuclear submarines the greatest inflow of water comes from the atlantic by way of the norwegian current which then flows along the eurasian coast water also enters from the pacific via the bering strait the east greenland current carries the major outflow temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes ice covers most of the ocean surface year round causing subfreezing temperatures much of the time the arctic is a major source of very cold air that inevitably moves toward the equator meeting with warmer air in the middle latitudes and causing rain and snow little marine life exists where the ocean surface is covered with ice throughout the year marine life abounds in open areas especially the more southerly waters the ocean s major ports are the russian cities of murmansk and arkhangelsk archangel the arctic ocean is important as the

oceans seas arctic the android data portrayed by brent spiner from the tv series star trek the next generation an android is an artificially created robot an automaton that resembles a human being usually both in appearance and behavior the word derives from the greek andr meaning man male and the suffix eides used to mean of the species alike from eidos species the word droid a robot in the star wars universe is derived from this meaning in the semantic sense the word android is a misnomer the intended meaning is an artificial human being like being while the literal translation is an artificial male being the word andros has definite meaning of male human being in greek while the word man can mean either male human being or human being in general the gender neutral word for human being in greek is anthropos and the correct word for an artificial human being like automaton would be anthropoid toc usage and distinctions unlike the terms robot a mechanical being and cyborg a being that is partly organic and partly mechanical the word android has been used in literature and other media to denote several different kinds of artificially constructed beings a robot that closely resembles a human a cyborg that closely resembles a human an artificially created yet primarily organic being that closely resembles a human although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence the term android was first used by the french author mathias villiers de l isle adam one eight three eight one eight eight nine in his work tomorrow s eve featuring an artificial human like robot named hadaly as said by the officer in the story in this age of realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls although karel apek s robots in r u r rossum s universal robots one nine two one the play that introduced the word robot to the world were organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts ambiguity historically science fiction authors have used android in a greater diversity of ways than the terms robot and cyborg in some fiction works the primary difference between a robot and android is only skin deep with androids being made to look almost exactly like humans on the outside but with internal mechanics exactly the same as that of robots in other stories authors have defined android to indicate a wholly organic yet artificial creation other definitions of android fall somewhere in between the character data from the television series star trek the next generation is described as an android data became intoxicated in an early episode the naked now and is later referred to having bioplast sheeting for skin the most toys perhaps suggesting that he was initially intended by the writers to be at least partially organic otherwise data was shown to be mechanical throughout and this often became a central plot theme the replicants from the movie blade runner were bioengineered organic beings while they were not referred to as either robots or androids in the movie the screenplay was originally based on a novel by philip k dick called do androids dream of electric sheep in the video game beneath a steel sky genetically engineered androids similar to blade runner s replicants are a central plot theme however despite their organic makeup their behavior is programmed by computer the robots of apek s r u r were organic in nature today an author writing a similar story might very well be inclined to call them androids the character ash in the movie alien another artificial organic being is often referred to as an android though not in the dialogue of the movie itself similarly the character bishop in aliens and alien is a more advanced android commonly called a synthetic but prefers to be called an artificial person much later in the series timeline the character call in alien resurrection is ashamed of being an android c three po and r two d two from the star wars movies are referred to as droids while c three po could reasonably be called an android because he is humanoid in appearance the squat cylinder r

essentially computers in a man made body the series does not go into their internal composition but it is assumed to be artificial with a very realistic outside one of the key points of this series was a special type of persicom named a chobit a persicom that had free will and the ability to fall in love and have emotions androids in fiction thus far androids have remained mostly within the domain of science fiction and frequently in film and television however some humanoid robots exist one of the earliest android characters is otho from the captain future stories of edmond hamilton

two five five two eight seven mi to the south it borders the us state of montana at a latitude of four nine n or the four nine th parallel to the east at a longitude of one one zero w it borders the province of saskatchewan at six zero n it is bordered by the northwest territories to the west its border with british columbia follows the line of peaks of the rocky mountains range along the continental divide which runs northwesterly until it reaches one two zero w at which point the border follows this meridian to six zero n with the exception of the southeastern section the province is well watered alberta contains dozens of rivers and lakes ideal for swimming water skiing fishing and a full range of other water sports there are a multitude of fresh water lakes each less than two six zero km situated in alberta and three of more considerable size these three larger lakes are lake athabasca seven eight nine eight km part of which lies in the province of saskatchewan lake claire one four three six km which lies just west of lake athabasca in wood bufflao national park and lesser slave lake one one six eight km which is well northwest of edmonton as alberta extends for one two zero zero km from north to south and about six zero zero km wide at its greatest east west extent it is natural that the climate should vary considerably between the four nine th and six zero th parallels it is also further influenced by altitude especially in the southwestern part of the province within the canadian rockies and adjacent areas directly to the east banff national park northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has fewer frost free days than southern alberta which is often semi arid due to the summer heat and much lower rainfall western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the warmth brought by winter chinook winds while southeastern alberta is flat dry prairie where temperatures can range from very cold three five c three one f in the winter to very hot three five c nine five f or higher in the summer central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after southern ontario central alberta is the most likely region in canada to experience tornadoes thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada overall alberta has cold winters with a daytime average of about one zero c one four f in the south to two four c one two f in the north in the summer the daytime temperature averages from about one three c five five f in the rocky mountains to one nine c six seven f in the dry prairie to the south east the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures alberta s capital city edmonton is located almost in the geographic centre of the province and most of alberta s oil is refined here southern alberta where calgary is located is known for its ranching much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with ranching predominantly a southern alberta industry in southeastern alberta where the red deer

article industry in alberta alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil synthetic crude natural gas and gas products in the country two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in north america are located in central and north central alberta in both red deer and edmonton world class polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world and edmonton s oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands previously known as the athabasca tar sands have estimated oil reserves in excess of that of the rest of the world estimated to be one six trillion barrels two five four km with the advancement of extraction methods bitumen and economical synthetic crude are produced at costs nearing that of conventional crude this technology is alberta grown and developed many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non conventional methods to extract the bitumen from the athabasca deposit with current technology only three one five billion barrels five zero km are recoverable fort mcmurray one of canada s youngest and liveliest cities has grown up entirely because of the large multinational corporations which have taken on the task of oil production another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the tar sands is the price of oil in two zero zero five record oil prices have made it more than profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss while edmonton is considered the pipeline junction manufacturing chemical processing research and refining centre of the province calgary is known for its senior and junior oil company head offices unlike edmonton calgary is not close to any large sources of oil with concerted effort and support from the provincial government several high tech industries have found their birth in alberta notably the invention and perfection of liquid crystal display systems with a growing economy alberta has several financial institutions dealing with several civil and private funds agriculture and forestry farm buildings alberta canola field grain elevator alberta agriculture has a significant position in the province s economy over five million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo bison for the consumer market sheep for wool and mutton are also raised wheat and canola are primary farm crops with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production with other grains also prominent much of the farming is dryland farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed hybrid canola also requires bee pollination and some beekeepers service this need the vast northern forest reserves of softwood allow alberta to produce large quantities of lumber and plywood and several northern alberta plants supply north america and the pacific rim nations with bleached wood pulp and newsprint

includes grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects albertans are the lowest taxed people in canada and alberta is the only province in canada without a provincial sales tax though residents are still subject to the federal sales tax the gst alberta s municipalities have their own governments which usually work in co operation with the provincial government alberta s politics are much more conservative than those of other canadian provinces alberta has traditionally had three political parties the progressive conservatives conservatives or tories the centrist liberals and the social democratic new democrats a fourth party the strongly conservative social credit party was a power in alberta for many decades but fell from the political map after the progressive conservatives came to power in the early one nine seven zero s since that time no other political party has governed alberta in fact only three parties have governed alberta the united farmers of alberta the social credit party and the currently governing progressive conservative party as is the case with many western canadian provinces alberta has had occasional bouts of separatist sentiment even during the one nine eight zero s when these feelings were at their strongest there has never been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movements or referenda there are a number of groups wishing to promote the independence of alberta in some form currently active in the province see also alberta separatism in the two zero zero four provincial election held in november

majority of alberta s schools are run by publicly funded school boards each with its own district of authority the largest are english language public school boards alberta also has english separate catholic boards throughout the province which serve a substantial minority of students there is one protestant school board in part of the province where numbers warrant there are francophone school boards public and separate catholic all five of these types of boards are primarily publicly funded basic school fees range from two zero zero seven five zero depending on the school board by local property taxes and provincial grants given on an equal per student basis by the province with some adjustments the different types of school boards are a necessity under the canadian constitution which guarantees the francophones and catholic communities both the right to their own schools and the right to administer them some other canadian provinces have reformed their school systems on non religious lines by seeking a constitutional amendment but alberta has not often the decision to go to one system or another is not based on religion but a parent s belief of which system provides a better education starting in one nine nine four the province has allowed some chartered schools to operate independently of any district school board reporting directly to the province homeschooling is officially recognized and partially funded from within the alberta school system originally in alberta school boards had the power to levy property taxes within their respective districts however this meant districts with a low tax base were underfunded so the province moved to a system that pools the education property tax and distributes it based on student population and need post secondary alberta s oldest and largest university is edmonton s university of alberta the university of calgary once affiliated with the university of alberta gained its autonomy in one nine six six and is now the second largest university in alberta there is also athabasca university which focuses on distance learning and the university of lethbridge there are one five colleges that receive direct public

highway two is supplimented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway two two west of highway two known as the cowboy trail and highway two one east of highway two alberta has two main east west corridors the southern corridor part of the trans canada highway system enters the province near medicine hat runs westward through calgary and leaves alberta through banff national park the northern corridor also part of the trans canada network but known alternatively as the yellowhead highway highway one six runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia on a sunny spring or fall day one of the most scenic drives in the world is along the icefields parkway which runs some three zero zero km between jasper and banff with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length urban stretches of alberta s major highways and freeways are often called trails for example highway two is deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary calgary trail as it leaves edmonton southbound and st albert trail as it leaves edmonton northbound toward the city of st albert visitors from outside alberta often find this disconcerting accustomed as they are to the notion that a trail is an unpaved route primarily for pedestrians edmonton calgary red deer medicine hat and lethbridge have substantial mass transit systems edmonton and calgary also operate light rail vehicles alberta is well connected by air with international airports at both edmonton and calgary calgary s airport is the larger of the two and

calgary have chinatowns and calgary s is canada s third largest aboriginal albertans make up approximately three percent of the population the major contributors to alberta s ethnic diversity have been the european nations forty four percent of albertans are of british and irish descent and there are also large numbers of germans ukrainians and scandinavians both cities heavily support first class canadian football league and national hockey league teams soccer rugby union and lacrosse are also played professionally in alberta tourism is also important to albertans a million visitors come

province of alberta as far north as about five three north latitude was a part of rupert s land from the time of the incorporation of the hudson s bay company one six seven zero after the arrival in the north west of the french around one seven three one they settled the prairies of the west establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonqui re was established near what is now calgary in one seven five two the north west company of montreal occupied the northern part of alberta territory before the hudson s bay company arrived from hudson bay to take possession of it the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who on behalf of the north west company of montreal built fort athabasca on lac la biche in one seven seven eight roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in one seven eight eight his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name the mackenzie river which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so being the first white man to cross the north american continent north of mexico the district of alberta was created as part of the north west territories in one eight eight two as settlement increased local representatives to the north west legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in one nine zero five the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status fauna and flora fauna the three climatic regions alpine forest and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the land of the bison its grasses providing a great pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a strong comeback and thrive on farms and in parks all over alberta alberta is home to many large carnivores among them are the grizzly and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the dog and cat families include coyotes wolves fox lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar rocky mountains bighorn sheep herbivorous or plant eating animals are found throughout the province moose and deer both mule and white tail varieties are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn antelope can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province alberta is fortunate in that it is home to only one variety of venomous snake the prairie rattlesnake central and northern alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of the migratory birds vast numbers of ducks geese swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta eagles hawks owls and crows are plentiful and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect eating birds can be found alberta like other temperate regions is home to mosquitoes flies wasps and bees rivers and lakes are well stocked with pike walleye white fish rainbow speckled and brown trout and even sturgeon turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta flora in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring brings the prairie anemone the avens crocuses and other early flowers the advancing summer introduces many flowers of the sunflower family until in august the plains are one blaze of yellow and purple the southern part of alberta is covered by a short grass very nutritive but dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the buffalo bean fleabane and sage both yellow and purple clover fill the roadways and the ditches with their beauty and aromatic scents the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically birch poplar and

circle is the northern temperate zone the arctic circle marks the southern extremity of the polar day of the summer solstice in june and the polar night of the winter solstice in december within the arctic circle the arctic sun is above the horizon for at least two four continuous hours once per year in conjunction with the arctic s summer solstice this is often referred to in local as midnight sun likewise in conjunction with the arctic s winter solstice the arctic sun will be below the horizon for at least two four continuous hours in fact because of refraction and because the sun appears as a disk and not a point part of the midnight sun may be seen at the night of the summer solstice up to about five zero nine zero km south of the geometric arctic circle similarly at the day of the winter solstice part of the sun may be seen up to about five zero north of the geometric arctic circle this is true at sea level these limits increase with elevation above sea level however in mountainous regions there is often no direct view of the horizon the position of the arctic circle is determined by the axial tilt angle of the polar axis of rotation of the earth on the ecliptic this angle is not constant but has a complex motion determined by many cycles of short to very long periods due to nutation the tilt oscillates over nine about two eight zero m on the surface over a period of one eight six years the main long term cycle has a period of four one zero zero zero years and an amplitude of about zero six eight or seven six km on the surface currently the tilt is decreasing by about zero four seven per year so the arctic circle is moving north by about one four m per year also see precession countries which have significant territory within the arctic circle are russia

automatic rifle bar was a world war i era weapon that used a full power round it was an automatic rifle by today s definition and designed for single accurate shots and suppressive automatic fire the weight of roughly one five pounds seven kg meant that it was rather cumbersome for closer quarters later developments added heavier barrels and bipods that lent it to being used as more like today s

using the four five acp cartridge these firearms are considered part of the submachine gun class but were an important part in the development of the assault rifles one nine three zero s automatic intermediate weapons some of these automatic and semi automatic firearms used new intermediate cartridges others used pre existing rounds an attempt to provide soldiers with a rifle with intermediate power ammunition that was heavier than a submachine gun too weak with short range due to the pistol ammunition but lighter than a long rifle uncomfortable to fire and difficult to control on fully automatic mode due to the powerful ammunition more expensive to design and manufacture by the italian arms company beretta resulted in the mab three eight moschetto automatico beretta one nine three eight the mab three eight used a fiocchi nine m three eight cartridge and a higher powered nine mm parabellum cartridge which could provide longer range fire the effective range was about two zero zero m although it was declared to be effective up to five zero zero m the mab three eight was a multipurpose weapon m one carbine u s unlike the m one the later m two and m three were fully automatic in one nine three eight prior to world war ii the united states introduced the m one carbine which was an intermediate power weapon chambered for the three zero carbine cartridge the m one carbine was originally planned to have automatic fire but this was dropped from the first version although later in the war selective fire variants were made m two and m three carbines the weapon had higher stopping power than submachine guns but was not as powerful as full size automatic rifles such as the bar the longer barrel one eight inch provided the carbine with higher muzzle velocity than pistols and submachine guns chambered for the same three zero round the m one carbine series was designed for close quarters engagements a concept that would be re applied later it marked the first time in which such an intermediate weapon would be mass produced in such large numbers it became the most produced american weapon of the war with millions made the m one carbine series would remain in service with the u s military until replaced by the m one six rifle in the one nine six zero s it continued to be used in other nations one nine four zero s and one nine five zero s maschinenkarabiner sturmgewehr others used new intermediate cartridges kinetic energy ranged between one four zero zero two one zero zero j one zero three three one five five zero foot pounds muzzle velocities of six zero zero eight zero zero m s one nine seven zero two six two five ft s and bullets of seven nine g one zero eight one three nine grains germany like other countries had studied the problem since world war i and their factories made a variety of non standard cartridges therefore having less incentive to retain their existing calibers the seven nine two three zero mm cartridge was an example of these experiments in one nine four one it was improved to seven nine two three three mm infanterie kurz patrone infantry short standard in one nine four two it was again improved as maschinenkarabiner patrone s and in one nine four three pistolen patrone four three me then finally infanterie kurz patrone four three it is just a coincidence but the intermediate cartridge developed by winchester for the m one carbine developed slightly before also measured three three mm in one nine four two walther presented the maschinenkarabiner automatic carbine abbr mkb named mkb four two w in the same year haenel presented the mkb four two h designed by hugo schmeisser as a result of this program rheinmetall borsig some said krieghoff presented its fg four two fallschirmjaeger gewehr four two sponsored by hermann g ring though this was in a different role and using a heavy eight five seven mm eight mm mauser cartridge which was not an intermediate round war time tests in russia indicated the mkb four two h performed better than the other two schmeisser developed it first as the mp four three then mp four three one and finally as the mp four four sturmgewehr four four abbreviated stg four four it immediately entered large scale production more than five zero zero zero units had been produced by february one nine four four and five five zero zero zero by the following november following the end of the war the soviet union developed the ak four seven which was vaguely similar in concept and layout to the german stg four four but extremely different mechanically it fired the seven six two three nine mm cartridge which had been developed during wwii the round was similar to the stg four four s in that the bullet was of a similar caliber to the russian rifle ammunition one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s lighter automatic weapons and lighter smaller bullets many of these automatic firearms used intermediate cartridges with much lighter bullets and smaller calibers but fired at very high velocity kinetic energy ranged between one three zero zero one eight zero zero j nine six zero one three three zero foot pounds velocities of nine zero zero one zero five zero m s two nine five zero three four five zero ft s and bullets of three four g four six six two grains sig five five zero swiss the sig fires gw pat nine zero which has the same caliber as the five five six mm nato many nations continued the development of traditional high powered rifles with ranges of five zero zero meters five five zero yards and beyond most designs of this period used low caliber but high velocity ammunition with some experiments in flechettes and other exotic ammunition statistical studies of world war ii battles performed by the u s army revealed that infantry combat beyond three zero zero meters three two five yards was rare the russians saw no reason to make a rifle that shot beyond a rifleman s ability to aim therefore a lighter less powerful cartridge could be effective this permitted a lighter rifle and enabled troops to carry more ammunition making them more autonomous a greater amount of the lighter ammunition could be transported in the same amount of space in addition the smaller size and handiness of an assault rifle would benefit tank crews support troops and units with missions other than front line combat the five five six four five mm nato cartridge was developed in the one nine six zero s and was adopted for use in the m one six assault rifle the m one six a one version soon followed and was then replaced in one nine eight two by the m one six a two the soviet union also developed its own similar round the five four five three nine mm which was used in the ak seven four the successor of the ak four seven these rounds are usually considered less lethal than the previous generation of assault rifle rounds that fired larger rifle caliber ammunition with reduced propellant but the smaller caliber and lighter bullets achieve higher velocities than even a hunting rifle bullet these high speeds induce additional lethality through bullet shattering although these high speed rounds generally do not exceed the momentum of the heavier but slower bullets of the less sophisticated ak four seven any pointed spitzer round will tumble in soft tissue if the jacket has a cannelure like the u s five five six four five mm m one nine three round the bullet will fragment leading to significant blood loss and internal damage blood loss leads to indirect incapacitation but often takes longer than direct destruction of tissue since combat use of rifles expends around five zero zero zero zero rounds in suppressive fire for each combatant killed trading lighter cartridge weight and lower recoil for slower but more sure incapacitation often makes good sense the key to the assault rifle concept is firing at both known and suspected enemy positions this allows an attacking infantry unit to shoot at a hidden enemy first rather than waiting for the enemy to fire first good volume and distribution of aimed suppressive fire delivered by infantry squad members as they maneuver prevents enemy return fire and in turn allows the assaulting unit to maneuver through enemy fields of fire faster faster maneuver limits the assaulting unit s vulnerability to small arms fire artillery mortars or counter attack of course this requires a larger basic ammunition load and steady supply of rifle ammunition one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s one nine nine zero s new form factors and features many of these automatic firearms usually used the same rounds as in older eras but focused on using new form factors materials and added features like standard telescopic and reflex sights famas france it was adopted in one nine seven eight the biggest change since adoption of high velocity rounds of five mm caliber and higher has been designs that have new form factors sights electronics and materials a number of bullpup rifles entered service in the late one nine seven zero s one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s although bullpup rifles had existed since the one nine three zero s the united kingdom s em two was one of the few bullpup assault rifles prior to this time examples of the new trend include the famas steyr aug and sa eight zero they were all bullpup rifles that made heavy use of composites and plastics with ambidextrous controls and the latter both added a low power telescopic sight to the standard service version the sar two one the tavor tar two one and qbz nine five follow a similar trend as well with a bullpup configuration and heavy use of composites the heckler seven mm range with rifle round velocities and lower mass bullets a kind of intermediate philosophy between the smaller caliber faster modern rounds and the standard caliber slower rounds of the previous generation china in the late one nine eight zero s introduced a five eight four two mm round with an initial velocity of nine three zero m s four two six g bullet and one eight four two j of energy china claims the new round provides superior performace and lethality to the nato and modern soviet intermediate rounds in the united states remington has developed the six eight mm remington spc cartridge which is the same overall length at the five five six x four five mm nato round but fires a bullet the same caliber at the two seven zero winchester hunting cartridge its similar size to the five five six four five mm means that existing rifles can be converted without an excessive amount of trouble development of a four seven three mm caseless ammunition and advanced assault rifle in the one nine seven zero one nine eight zero s by germany was effectively halted by the german reunification in one nine nine zero and that rifle never entered full production assault weapons vs fully automatic weapons primarily in the united states the term assault weapon is an arbitrary and politicized phrase generally used to describe a collection of semi automatic firearms that have certain features associated with military police use such as a folding stock flash suppressor bayonet protruding pistol grip or the ability to accept a detachable magazine of a capacity larger than ten rounds the phrase assault weapon has been used primarily in relation to a specific expired gun law that was commonly known as the assault weapons ban clinton gun ban or one nine nine four crime bill it is a common misconception that the assault weapons ban restricted weapons capable of fully automatic fire such as assault rifles and machine guns fully automatic weapons were unaffected by the ban because they have been heavily restricted since the national firearms act of one nine three four and other more recent laws the term assault weapon has often been erroneously used to describe machine guns many states and localities still use the term assault weapon with a variety of

federal assault weapons ban usa firearm action gas operated list of firearms external links assault rifles and their ammunition history and prospects rifles assault rifles animals are a major group of organisms classified as the kingdom animalia or metazoa in general they are multicellular capable of locomotion and responsive to their environment and feed by consuming other organisms their body plan becomes fixed as they develop usually early on in their development as embryos although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later on the name animal comes from the latin word animal of which animalia is the plural and ultimately from anima meaning vital breath or soul characteristics kingdom animalia has several characteristics that set it apart from other living things animals are eukaryotic and multicellular which separates them from bacteria and most protists they are heterotrophic generally digesting food in an internal chamber which separates them from plants and algae they are also distinguished from plants algae and fungi by lacking cell walls structure with a few exceptions most notably the sponges phylum porifera animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues these include muscles which are able to contract and control locomotion and a nervous system which sends and processes signals there is also typically an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings animals with this sort of organization are called metazoans or eumetazoans when the former is used for animals in general all animals have eukaryotic cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins this may be calcified to form structures like shells bones and spicules during development it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized making complex structures possible in contrast other multicellular organisms like plants and fungi have cells held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth also unique to animal cells are the following intercellular junctions tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes reproduction and development nearly all animals undergo some form of sexual reproduction adults are diploid or occasionally polyploid they have a few specialized reproductive cells which undergo meiosis to produce smaller motile spermatozoa or larger non motile ova these fuse to form zygotes which develop into new individuals many animals are also capable of asexual reproduction this may take place through parthenogenesis where fertile eggs are produced without mating or in some cases through fragmentation a zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called a blastula which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge in most other groups the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement it first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm in most cases a mesoderm also develops between them these germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs animals grow by indirectly using the energy of sunlight plants use this energy to turn air into simple sugars using a process known as photosynthesis these sugars are then used as the building blocks which allow the plant to grow when animals eat these plants or eat other animals which have eaten plants the sugars produced by the plant are used by the animal they are either used directly to help the animal grow or broken down releasing stored solar energy and giving the animal the energy required for motion this process is known as glycolysis origin and fossil record animals are generally considered to have evolved from flagellate protozoa their closest living relatives are the choanoflagellates collared flagellates that have the same structure as certain sponge cells do molecular studies place them in a supergroup called the opisthokonts which also include the fungi and a few small parasitic protists the name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells such as most animal sperm whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella the first fossils that might represent animals appear towards the end of the precambrian around six zero zero million years ago and are known as the vendian biota these are difficult to relate to later fossils however some may represent precursors of modern phyla but they may be separate groups and it is possible they are not really animals at all aside from them most known animal phyla make a more or less simultaneous appearance during the cambrian period about five seven zero million years ago it is still disputed whether this event called the cambrian explosion represents a rapid divergence between different groups or a change in conditions that made fossilization possible groups of animals elephant ear sponge the sponges porifera diverged from other animals early as mentioned they lack the complex organization found in most other phyla their cells are differentiated but not organized into distinct tissues sponges are sessile and typically feed by drawing in water through pores archaeocyatha which have fused skeletons may represent sponges or a separate phylum brain coral among the eumetazoan phyla two are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening which serves as both the mouth and the anus these are the cnidaria which include sea anemones corals and jellyfish and the ctenophora or comb jellies both have distinct tissues but they are not organized into organs there are only two main germ layers the ectoderm and endoderm with only scattered cells between them as such these animals are sometimes called diploblastic the tiny phylum placozoa is similar but individuals do not have a permanent digestive chamber the remaining animals form a monophyletic group called the bilateria for the most part they are bilaterally symmetric and often have a specialized head with feeding and sensory organs the body is triploblastic i e all three germ layers are well developed and tissues form distinct organs the digestive chamber has two openings a mouth and an anus and there is also an internal body cavity called a coelom or pseudocoelom there are exceptions to each of these characteristics however for instance adult echinoderms are radially symmetric and certain parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures clownfish in their sea anemone home genetic studies have considerably changed our understanding of the relationships within the bilateria most appear to belong to four major lineages deuterostomes ecdysozoa platyzoa lophotrochozoa in addition to these there are a few small groups of bilaterians with relatively similar structure that appear to have diverged before these major groups these include the acoelomorpha rhombozoa and orthonectida the myxozoa single celled parasites that were originally considered protozoa are now believed to have developed from the bilateria as well the magellanic penguin deuterostomes deuterostomes differ from the other bilateria called protostomes in several ways in both cases there is a complete digestive tract however in protostomes the initial opening the archenteron develops into the mouth and an anus forms separately in deuterostomes this is reversed in most protostomes cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm called schizocoelous development but in deuterostomes it forms through invagination of the endoderm called enterocoelic pouching deuterostomes also have a dorsal rather than a ventral nerve chord and their embryos undergo different cleavage all this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate monophyletic lineages the main phyla of deuterostomes are the echinodermata and chordata the former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine such as sea stars sea urchins and sea cucumbers the latter are dominated by the vertebrates animals with backbones these include fish amphibians reptiles birds and mammals in addition to these the deuterostomes also include the hemichordata or acorn worms although they are not especially prominent today the important fossil graptolites may belong to this group the chaetognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes but this is less certain ecdysozoa the yellow winged darter the ecdysozoa are protostomes named after the common trait of growth by moulting or ecdysis the largest animal phylum belongs here the arthropoda including insects spiders crabs and their kin all these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments typically with paired appendages two smaller phyla the onychophora and tardigrada are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits roundworm the ecdysozoans also include the nematoda or roundworms the second largest animal phylum roundworms are typically microscopic and occur in nearly every environment where there is water a number are important parasites smaller phyla related to them are the nematomorpha or horsehair worms which are visible to the unaided eye and the kinorhyncha priapulida and loricifera which are all microscopic these groups have a reduced coelom called a pseudocoelom the remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes grouped together as the spiralia since in both embryos develop with spiral cleavage bedford s flatworm platyzoa the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes the flatworms these were originally considered some of the most primitive bilateria but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors rotifer a number of parasites are included in this group such as the flukes and tapeworms flatworms lack a coelom as do their closest relatives the microscopic gastrotricha the other platyzoan phyla are microscopic and pseudocoelomate the most prominent are the rotifera or rotifers which are common in aqueous environments they also include the acanthocephala or spiny headed worms the gnathostomulida micrognathozoa and possibly the cycliophora these groups share the presence of complex jaws from which they are called the gnathifera lophotrochozoa big blue octopus the lophotrochozoa include two of the most successful animal phyla the mollusca and annelida the former includes animals such as snails clams and squids and the latter comprises the segmented worms such as earthworms and leeches these two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented now this is generally considered convergent evolution owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla the lophotrochozoa also include the nemertea or ribbon worms the sipuncula and several phyla that have a fan of cilia around the mouth called a lophophore these were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates but it now appears they are paraphyletic some closer to the nemertea and some to the mollusca and annelida they include the brachiopoda or lamp shells which are prominent in the fossil record the entoprocta the phoronida and possibly the bryozoa or moss animals history of classification white s tree frog vulpes vulpes the red fox aristotle divided the living world between animals and plants and this was followed by carolus linnaeus in the first hierarchical classification since then biologists have begun emphasizing evolutionary relationships and so these groups have been restricted somewhat for instance microscopic protozoa were originally considered animals because they move but are now treated separately in linnaeus original scheme the animals were one of three kingdoms divided into the classes of vermes insecta pisces amphibia aves and mammalia since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum the chordata whereas the various other forms have been separated out the above lists represent our current understanding of the group though there is some variation from source to source usage of the word animal in everyday usage animal refers to any member of the animal kingdom that is not a human being and sometimes excludes insects although including such arthropods as crabs this confusion stems primarily from the familiarity with zoo animals farm animals and pets not from an analytical distinction between insects humans

german born theoretical physicist widely regarded as the greatest scientist of the two zero th century he was the author of the general theory of relativity and made important contributions to the special theory of relativity quantum mechanics statistical mechanics and cosmology he was awarded the one nine two one nobel prize for physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect in one nine zero five his miracle year and for his services to theoretical physics after british solar eclipse expeditions in one nine one nine confirmed that light rays from distant stars were deflected by the gravity of the sun in the exact amount he predicted in his general theory of relativity einstein became world famous an unusual achievement for a scientist in his later years his fame exceeded that of any other scientist in history in popular culture his name has become synonymous with great intelligence and genius biography young einstein before the einsteins moved from germany to italy youth and college einstein was born on march one four one eight seven nine at ulm in baden w rttemberg german empire about one zero zero km east of stuttgart his parents were hermann einstein a featherbed salesman who later ran an electrochemical works and pauline whose maiden name was koch they were married in stuttgart bad cannstatt the family was jewish non observant albert attended a catholic elementary school and at the insistence of his mother was given violin lessons though he initially disliked and eventually discontinued the lessons he would later take great solace in mozart s violin sonatas when albert was five his father showed him a pocket compass and einstein realized that something in empty space acted upon the needle he would later describe the experience as one of the most revelatory of his life though he built models and mechanical devices for fun and showed great mathematical faculty early on he was considered a slow learner possibly due to dyslexia simple shyness or the significantly rare and unusual structure of his brain examined after his death he later credited his development of the theory of relativity to this slowness saying that by pondering space and time later than most children he was able to apply a more developed intellect some researchers have speculated that einstein may have exhibited some traits of mild forms of autism although they concede that a reliable posthumous diagnosis is impossible in one eight eight nine a student named max talmud introduced einstein to key science and philosophy texts including kant s critique of pure reason two of his uncles would further foster his intellectual interests during his late childhood and early adolescence by suggesting and providing books on science mathematics and philosophy einstein attended the luitpold gymnasium where he received a relatively progressive education he began to learn mathematics around age twelve in one eight nine one he taught himself euclidean plane geometry from a school booklet and began to study calculus there is a recurring rumor that he failed mathematics later in his education but this is untrue a change in the way grades were assigned caused confusion years later while there he clashed with authority and resented the school regimen believing the spirit of learning and creative thought were lost in such an endeavor as strict memorization in one eight nine four following the failure of hermann s electrochemical business the einsteins moved from munich to pavia italy near milan einstein s first scientific work was written therein called the investigation of the state of aether in magnetic fields albert remained behind in munich lodgings to finish school completing only one term before leaving the gymnasium in spring one eight nine five to rejoin his family in pavia he quit without telling his parents and a year and a half prior to final examinations einstein convinced the school to let him go with a medical note from a friendly doctor but this meant he had no secondary school certificate that year at the age of one six he performed the thought experiment known as albert einstein s mirror after gazing into a mirror he examined what would happen to his image if he were moving at the speed of light his conclusion that the speed of light is independent of the observer would later become one of the two postulates of special relativity despite excelling in the mathematics and science portion his failure of the liberal arts portion of the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth swiss federal institute of technology in zurich entrance exam the following year was a setback his family sent him to aarau switzerland to finish secondary school where he studied the seldom taught maxwell s electromagnetic theory and received his diploma in september one eight nine six during this time he lodged with professor jost winteler s family and became enamoured with marie their daughter his first sweetheart albert s sister maja was to later marry their son paul and his friend michele besso married their other daughter anna einstein subsequently enrolled at the eidgen ssische technische hochschule in october and moved to zurich while marie moved to olsberg for a teaching post the same year he renounced his w rttemberg citizenship and became stateless in the spring of one eight nine six the serbian mileva mari started initially as a medical student at the university of zurich but after a term switched to the same section as einstein as the only woman that year to study for the same diploma einstein s relationship with mileva developed into romance over the next few years in one nine zero zero he was granted a teaching diploma by the eidgen ssische technische hochschule eth zurich einstein then wrote his first published paper on the capillary forces of a drinking straw wherein he tried to unify the laws of physics an attempt he would continually make throughout his life it was titled folgerungen aus den capillarit tserscheinungen which translated is consequences of the observations of capillarity phenomena found in annalen der physik volume four page five one three shortly following einstein was accepted as a swiss citizen in one nine zero one he kept his swiss passport for his whole life through his friend michelle besso an engineer he was presented with the works of ernst mach and later would consider him the best sounding board in europe for physical ideas during this time einstein discussed his scientific interests with a group of close friends including besso and mileva the men referred to themselves as the olympia academy he and mileva had an illegitimate daughter lieserl born in january one nine zero two work and doctorate einstein in one nine zero five when he wrote the annus mirabilis papers upon graduation einstein could not find a teaching post mostly because his brashness as a young man had apparently irritated most of his professors the father of a classmate helped him obtain employment as a technical assistant examiner at the swiss patent office in one nine zero two there einstein judged the worth of inventors patent applications for devices that required a knowledge of physics to understand in particular he was chiefly charged to evaluate patents relating to electromagnetic devices he also learned how to discern the essence of applications despite sometimes poor descriptions and was taught by the director how to express himself correctly he occasionally rectified their design errors while evaluating the practicality of their work einstein married mileva mari on january six one nine zero three einstein s marriage to mari who was a mathematician was both a personal and intellectual partnership einstein referred to mileva as a creature who is my equal and who is as strong and independent as i am ronald w clark a biographer of einstein claimed that einstein depended on the distance that existed in his and mileva s marriage in order to have the solitude necessary to accomplish his work he required intellectual isolation abram joffe a soviet physicist who knew einstein in an obituary of einstein wrote the author of the papers of one nine zero five was a bureaucrat at the patent office in bern einstein mari and this has recently been taken as evidence of a collaborative relationship however according to alberto a mart nez of the center for einstein studies at boston university joffe only ascribed authorship to einstein as he believed that it was a swiss custom at the time to append the spouse s last name to the husband s name whatever the truth the extent of her influence on einstein s work is a highly controversial and debated question on may one four one nine zero four the couple s first son hans albert einstein was born in one nine zero three einstein s position at the swiss patent office had been made permanent though he was passed over for promotion until he had fully mastered machine technology he obtained his doctorate after submitting his thesis a new determination of molecular dimensions eine neue bestimmung der molek ldimensionen in one nine zero five that same year he wrote four articles that provided the foundation of modern physics without much scientific literature to which he could refer or many scientific colleagues with whom he could discuss the theories most physicists agree that three of those papers on brownian motion the photoelectric effect and special relativity deserved nobel prizes only the paper on the photoelectric effect would be mentioned by the nobel committee in the award this is ironic not only because einstein is far better known for relativity but also because the photoelectric effect is a quantum phenomenon and einstein became somewhat disenchanted with the path quantum theory would take in each of these papers einstein boldly took an idea from theoretical physics to its logical consequences and managed to explain experimental results that had baffled scientists for decades max planck and einstein annus mirabilis papers einstein submitted the series of papers to the annalen der physik they are commonly referred to as the annus mirabilis papers from annus mirabilis latin for year of wonders the international union of pure and applied physics iupap commemorated the one zero zero th year of the publication of einstein s extensive work in one nine zero five as the world year of physics two zero zero five the first paper named on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light ber einen die erzeugung und verwandlung des lichtes betreffenden heuristischen gesichtspunkt proposed that energy quanta which are essentially what we now call photons were real and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect this paper was specifically cited for his nobel prize max planck had made the formal assumption that energy was quantized in deriving his black body radiation law published in one nine zero one but had considered this to be no more than a mathematical trick the photoelectric effect thus provided a simple confirmation of max planck s hypothesis of quanta his second article in one nine zero five named on the motion required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid ber die von der molekularkinetischen theorie der w rme geforderte bewegung von in ruhenden fl ssigkeiten suspendierten teilchen covered his study of brownian motion and provided empirical evidence for the existence of atoms before this paper atoms were recognized as a useful concept but physicists and chemists hotly debated whether atoms were real entities einstein s statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope wilhelm ostwald one of the leaders of the anti atom school later told arnold sommerfeld that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by einstein s complete explanation of brownian motion at the same time as einstein brownian motion was also described by smoluchowski einstein s third paper that year on the electrodynamics of moving bodies zur elektrodynamik bewegter k rper was published in september one nine zero five this paper introduced the special theory of relativity a theory of time distance mass and energy which was consistent with electromagnetism but omitted the force of gravity while developing this paper einstein wrote to mileva about our work on relative motion and this has led some to ask whether mileva played a part in its development a few historians of science believe that einstein and his wife were both aware that the famous frenchman henri poincar had already published the equations of relativity a few weeks before einstein submitted his paper most believe their work independent especially given einstein s isolation at this time a fourth paper does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content ist die tr gheit eines k rpers von seinem energieinhalt abh ngig published late in one nine zero five showed one further deduction from relativity s axioms the famous equation that the energy of a body at rest e equals its mass m times the speed of light c squared e mc middle years einstein at the one nine one one solvay conference in one nine zero six einstein was promoted to technical examiner second class in one nine zero eight einstein was licensed in bern switzerland as a privatdozent unsalaried teacher at a university einstein s second son eduard was born on july two eight one nine one zero at this time he described why the sky is blue in his paper on the phenomenon of critical opalescence which shows the cumulative effect of scattering of light by individual molecules in the atmosphere in one nine one one einstein became first associate professor at the university of zurich and shortly afterwards full professor at the german university of prague only to return the following year to zurich in order to become full professor at the eth zurich at that time he worked closely with the mathematician marcel grossmann in one nine one two einstein started to refer to time as the fourth dimension although h g wells had done this earlier in one eight nine five in the time machine in one nine one four just before the start of world war i einstein settled in berlin as professor at the local university and became a member of the prussian academy of sciences he took german citizenship his pacifism and jewish origins irritated german nationalists after he became world famous nationalistic hatred of him grew and for the first time he was the subject of an organized campaign to discredit his theories from one nine one four to one nine three three he served as director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics in berlin and it was during this time that he was awarded his nobel prize and made his most groundbreaking discoveries he was also an extraordinary professor at the leiden university from one nine two zero until officially one nine four six where he regularly gave guest lectures in one nine one seven einstein published on the quantum mechanics of radiation zur quantenmechanik der strahlung physkalische zeitschrift one eight one two one one two eight this article introduced the concept of stimulated emission the physical principle that allows light amplification in the laser he also published a paper that year that used the general theory of relativity to model the behavior of the entire universe setting the stage for modern cosmology in this work he created his self described worst blunder the cosmological constant einstein divorced mileva on february one four one nine one nine and married his cousin elsa l wenthal born einstein l wenthal was the surname of her first husband max on june two one nine one nine elsa was albert s first cousin maternally and his second cousin paternally she was three years older than albert and had nursed him to health after he had suffered a partial nervous breakdown combined with a severe stomach ailment there were no children from this marriage the fate of albert and mileva s first child lieserl is unknown some believe she died in infancy while others believe she was given out for adoption they later had two sons eduard and hans albert eduard intended to practice as a freudian analyst but was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum hans albert his older brother became a professor of hydraulic engineering at the university of california berkeley having little interaction with his father einstein theory triumphs declared the new york times on november one zero one nine one nine general relativity in november one nine one five einstein presented a series of lectures before the prussian academy of sciences in which he described his theory of gravity known as general relativity the final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced newton s law of gravity the field equation which was first derived from a variational principle by david hilbert this theory considered all observers to be equivalent not only those moving at a uniform speed in general relativity gravity is no longer a force as it is in newton s law of gravity but is a consequence of the curvature of space time the theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were discovered well after einstein s death a truly revolutionary theory general relativity has so far passed every test posed to it and has become a powerful tool used in the analysis of many subjects in physics initially scientists were skeptical because the theory was derived by mathematical reasoning and rational analysis not by experiment or observation but in one nine one nine predictions made using the theory were confirmed by arthur eddington s measurements during a solar eclipse of how much the light emanating from a star was bent by the sun s gravity when it passed close to the sun an effect called gravitational lensing the observations were carried out on may two nine one nine one nine at two locations one in sobral cear brazil and another in the island of principe in the west coast of africa on november seven the times reported the confirmation cementing einstein s fame many scientists were still unconvinced for various reasons ranging from disagreement with einstein s interpretation of the experiments to not being able to tolerate the absence of an absolute frame of reference in einstein s view many of them simply could not understand the mathematics involved einstein s public fame which followed the one nine one nine article created resentment among these scientists some of which lasted well into the one nine three zero s in the early one nine two zero s einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the university of berlin on march three zero one nine two one einstein went to new york to give a lecture on his new theory of relativity the same year he was awarded the nobel prize though he is now most famous for his work on relativity it was for his earlier work on the photoelectric effect that he was given the prize as his work on general relativity was still disputed the nobel committee decided that citing his less contested theory in the prize would gain more acceptance from the scientific community sir edmund whittaker one nine five three stated that david hilbert published the theory of general relativity nearly simultaneously with einstein the copenhagen interpretation einstein and niels bohr sparred over quantum theory during the one nine two zero s einstein s postulation that light can be described not only as a wave with no kinetic energy but also as massless discrete packets of energy called quanta with measurable kinetic energy now known as photons was a landmark break with the classical physics in one nine zero nine einstein presented his first paper on the quantification of light to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together in the mid one nine two zero s as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new theory of quantum mechanics einstein balked at the copenhagen interpretation of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic non visualizable account of physical behaviour einstein agreed that the theory was the best available but he looked for a more complete explanation i e more deterministic he could not abandon the belief that physics described the laws that govern real things the belief which had led to his successes with atoms photons and gravity in a one nine two six letter to max born einstein made a remark that is now famous quantum mechanics is certainly imposing but an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing the theory says a lot but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the old one i at any rate am convinced that he does not throw dice to this bohr who sparred with einstein on quantum theory retorted stop telling god what he must do the bohr einstein debates on foundational aspects of quantum mechanics happened during the solvay conferences einstein was not rejecting probabilistic theories per se einstein himself was a great statistician using statistical analysis in his works on brownian motion and photoelectricity and in papers published before the miraculous year one nine zero five einstein had even discovered gibbs ensembles he believed however that at the core reality behaved deterministically many physicists argue that experimental evidence contradicting this belief was found much later with the discovery of bell s theorem and bell s inequality nonetheless there is still space for lively discussions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics bose einstein statistics in one nine two four einstein received a short paper from a young indian physicist named satyendra nath bose describing light as a gas of photons and asking for einstein s assistance in publication einstein realized that the same statistics could be applied to atoms and published an article in german then the lingua franca of physics which described bose s model and explained its implications bose einstein statistics now describe any assembly of these indistinguishable particles known as bosons the bose einstein condensate phenomenon was predicted in the one nine two zero s by bose and einstein based on bose s work on the statistical mechanics of photons which was then formalized and generalized by einstein the first such condensate was produced by eric cornell and carl wieman in one nine nine five at the university of colorado at boulder einstein s original sketches on this theory were recovered in august two zero zero five in the library of leiden university einstein also assisted erwin schr dinger in the development of the quantum boltzmann distribution a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model although he realized that this was less significant than the bose einstein model and declined to have his name included on the paper the einstein refrigerator einstein and szil rd s refrigerator patent diagram einstein and former student le szil rd co invented a unique type of refrigerator usually called the einstein refrigerator in one nine two six on november one one one nine three zero was awarded to albert einstein and le szil rd the patent covered a thermodynamic refrigeration cycle providing cooling with no moving parts at a constant pressure with only heat as an input the refrigeration cycle used ammonia butane and water world war ii when adolf hitler came to power in january one nine three three einstein was a guest professor at princeton university a position which he took in december one nine three two after a invitation from the american educator abraham flexner in one nine three three the nazis passed the law of the restoration of the civil service which forced all jewish university professors out of their jobs and throughout the one nine three zero s a campaign to label einstein s work as jewish physics in contrast with german or aryan physics was led by nobel laureates philipp lenard and johannes stark with the assistance of the ss the deutsche physik supporters worked to publish pamplets and textbooks denigrating einstein s theories and attempted to politically blacklist german physicists who taught them notably werner heisenberg einstein renounced his german citizenship and stayed in the united states where he was given permanent residency he accepted a position at the newly founded institute for advanced study in princeton township new jersey he became an american citizen in one nine four zero though he still retained swiss citizenship in one nine three nine under the encouragement of szil rd einstein sent a letter to president franklin delano roosevelt urging the study of nuclear fission for military purposes under fears that the nazi government would be first to develop atomic weapons roosevelt started a small investigation into the matter which eventually became the massive manhattan project einstein himself did not work on the bomb project however the international rescue committee was founded one nine three three at the request of albert einstein to assist opponents of adolf hitler for more information see the section below on einstein s political views institute for advanced study his work at the institute for advanced study focused on the unification of the laws of physics which he referred to as the unified field theory he attempted to construct a model which would describe all of the fundamental forces as different manifestations of a single force this took the form of an attempt to unify the gravitational and electrodynamic forces his attempt was hindered because the strong and weak nuclear forces were not understood independently until around one nine seven zero fifteen years after einstein s death einstein s goal of unifying the laws of physics under a single model survives in the current drive for unification of the forces embodied most notably by string theory generalized theory einstein began to form a generalized theory of gravitation with the universal law of gravitation and the electromagnetic force in his first attempt to demonstrate the unification and simplification of the fundamental forces in one nine five zero he described his work in a scientific american article einstein was guided by a belief in a single statistical measure of variance for the entire set of physical laws einstein s generalized theory of gravitation is a universal mathematical approach to field theory he investigated reducing the different phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or evident einstein tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism in a way that also led to a new subtle understanding of quantum mechanics einstein postulated a four dimensional space time continuum expressed in axioms represented by five component vectors particles appear in his research as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high einstein treated subatomic particles as objects embedded in the unified field influencing it and existing as an essential constituent of the unified field but not of it einstein also investigated a natural generalization of symmetrical tensor fields treating the combination of two parts of the field as being a natural procedure of the total field and not the symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts separately he researched a way to delineate the equations and systems to be derived from a variational principle einstein became increasingly isolated in his research on a generalised theory of gravitation and was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts in particular his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces ignored work in the physics community at large most notably the discovery of the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force einstein s two story house white frame with front porch in greek revival style in princeton one one two mercer street final years in one nine four eight einstein served on the original committee which resulted in the founding of brandeis university a portrait of einstein was taken by yousuf karsh on february one one of that same year in one nine five two the israeli government proposed to einstein that he take the post of second president he declined the offer and remains the only united states citizen ever to be offered a position as a foreign head of state on march three zero one nine five three einstein released a revised unified field theory he died at one one five am in princeton hospital in princeton new jersey on april one eight one nine five five at the age of seven six from internal bleeding which was caused by the rupture of an aortic aneurism leaving the generalized theory of gravitation unsolved the only person present at his deathbed a hospital nurse said that just before his death he mumbled several words in german that she did not understand he was cremated without ceremony on the same day he died at trenton new jersey in accordance with his wishes his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location an autopsy was performed on einstein by dr thomas stoltz harvey who removed and preserved his brain harvey found nothing unusual with his brain but in one nine nine nine further analysis by a team at mcmaster university revealed that his parietal operculum region was missing and to compensate his inferior parietal lobe was one five wider than normal the inferior parietal region is responsible for mathematical thought visuospatial cognition and imagery of movement einstein s brain also contained seven three more glial cells than the average brain personality albert einstein was much respected for his kind and friendly demeanor rooted in his pacifism he was modest about his abilities and had distinctive attitudes and fashions for example he minimized his wardrobe so that he would not need to waste time in deciding on what to wear he was captivatingly simple wearing mothy sweaters and sweatshirts and sans socks in his old age he occasionally had a playful sense of humor and enjoyed sailing and playing the violin he was also the stereotypical bumbling absent minded professor he was often forgetful of everyday items such as keys and would focus so intently on solving physics problems that he would often become oblivious to his surroundings in his later years his appearance inadvertently created or reflected another stereotype of scientist in the process the researcher with unruly white hair religious views although he was raised jewish he was not a believer in the religious aspect of judaism though he still considered himself a jew he simply admired the beauty of nature and the universe from a letter written in english dated march two four one nine five four einstein wrote it was of course a lie what you read about my religious convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it he also said in an essay reprinted in living philosophies vol one three one nine three one a knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity in this sense and this sense alone i am a deeply religious man the following is a response made to rabbi herbert goldstein of the international synagogue in new york which read i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings after being pressed on his religious views by martin buber einstein exclaimed what we physicists strive for is just to draw his lines after him he also quoted once when i read the bhagavad gita i ask myself how god created the universe everything else seems superfluous summarizing his religious beliefs he once said my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind einstein was an honorary associate of the rationalist press association beginning in one nine three four and was an admirer of ethical culture political views einstein and solomon mikhoels the chairman of the soviet jewish anti fascist committee in one nine four three einstein considered himself a pacifist and humanitarian and in later years a committed democratic socialist he once said i believe gandhi s views were the most enlightened of all the political men of our time we should strive to do things in his spirit not to use violence for fighting for our cause but by non participation of anything you believe is evil einstein s views on other issues including socialism mccarthyism and racism were controversial in a one nine four nine article entitled why socialism albert einstein described the predatory phase of human development exemplified by a chaotic capitalist society as a source of evil to be overcome he disapproved of the totalitarian regimes in the soviet union and elsewhere and argued in favor of a democratic socialist system which would combine a planned economy with a deep respect for human rights einstein was a co founder of the liberal german democratic party and a member of the afl cio affiliated union the american federation of teachers einstein was very much involved in the civil rights movement he was a close friend of paul robeson for over two zero years einstein was a member of several civil rights groups including the princeton chapter of the naacp many of which were headed by paul robeson he served as co chair with paul robeson of the american crusade to end lynching when w e b dubois was frivolously charged with being a communist spy during the mccarthy era while he was in his eight zero s einstein volunteered as a character witness in the case the case was dismissed shortly after it was announced that he was to appear in that capacity einstein was quoted as saying that racism is america s greatest disease the u s fbi kept a one four two seven page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the united states under the alien exclusion act alleging that einstein believes in advises advocates or teaches a doctrine which in a legal sense as held by the courts in other cases would allow anarchy to stalk in unmolested and result in government in name only among other charges they also alleged that einstein was a member sponsor or affiliated with thirty four communist fronts between one nine three seven one nine five four and also served as honorary chairman for three communist organizations it should be noted that many of the documents in the file were submitted to the fbi mainly by civilian political groups and not actually written by fbi officials in one nine three nine einstein signed a letter written by le szil rd to president roosevelt arguing that the united states should start funding research into the development of nuclear weapons einstein opposed tyrannical forms of government and for this reason and his jewish background opposed the nazi regime and fled germany shortly after it came to power at the same time einstein s anarchist nephew carl einstein who shared many of his views was fighting the fascists in the spanish civil war einstein initially favored construction of the atomic bomb in order to ensure that hitler did not do so first and even sent a letter to president roosevelt dated august two one nine three nine before world war ii broke out and probably written by le szil rd encouraging him to initiate a program to create a nuclear weapon roosevelt responded to this by setting up a committee for the investigation of using uranium as a weapon which in a few years was superseded by the manhattan project after the war though einstein lobbied for nuclear disarmament and a world government i do not know how the third world war will be fought but i can tell you what they will use in the fourth rocks einstein was a supporter of zionism he supported jewish settlement of the ancient seat of judaism and was active in the establishment of the hebrew university in jerusalem which published one nine three zero a volume titled about zionism speeches and lectures by professor albert einstein and to which einstein bequeathed his papers however he opposed nationalism and expressed skepticism about whether a jewish nation state was the best solution he may have imagined jews and arabs living peacefully in the same land in later life in one nine five two he was offered the post of second president of the newly created state of israel but declined the offer claiming that he lacked the necessary people skills einstein was disturbed by the violence taking place in the palestine after the second world war and expressed that he was disappointed with the jewish ultra nationalist organization irgun and stern gang nonetheless einstein remained deeply committed to the welfare of israel and the jewish people for the rest of his life einstein along with albert schweitzer and bertrand russell fought against nuclear tests and bombs as his last public act and just days before his death he signed the russell einstein manifesto which led to the pugwash conferences on science and world affairs his letter to russell read dear bertrand russell thank you for your letter of april five i am gladly willing to sign your excellent statement i also agree with your choice of the prospective signers with kind regards a einstein nationality german swiss or american einstein was born a german citizen at the age of seventeen on january two eight one eight nine six he was released from the german citizenship by his own request and with the approval of his father he remained stateless for five years on february two one one nine zero one he gained swiss citizenship which he never revoked einstein regained german citizenship in april one nine one four when he entered german civil service but due to the political situation and the persecution of jewish people in nazi germany he left civil service in march one nine three three and thus also lost the german citizenship on october one one nine four zero einstein became an american citizen he remained both an american and a swiss citizen until his death on april one eight one nine five five popularity and cultural impact einstein s popularity has led to widespread use of einstein in advertising and merchandising including the registration of albert einstein as a trademark the photo detail from the original of this humorous expression was taken during einstein s birthday on march one four one

as a model for depictions of eccentric scientists in works of fiction his own character and distinctive hairstyle suggest eccentricity or even lunacy and are widely copied or exaggerated time magazine writer frederic golden referred to einstein as a cartoonist s dream come true on einstein s seven two nd birthday in one nine five one the upi photographer arthur sasse was trying to coax him into smiling for the camera having done this for the photographer many times that day einstein stuck out his tongue instead the image has become an icon in pop culture for its contrast of the genius

einstein field equation rather than being named after hilbert hilbert had carried out the last few mathematical steps to its discovery independently and almost simultaneously with einstein but einstein was responsible for essentially everything that preceded those steps the recognition that tidal gravity must be the same thing as a warpage of spacetime the vision that the law of warpage

pakistan in the south and east turkmenistan uzbekistan and tajikistan in the north and china to the east it has a population of three zero million people although this remains an estimate as no official census has been taken for decades afghanistan literally translates to land of the afghans but a plethora of other names have been applied to its general location in the past between the fall of the taliban after the u s invasion of afghanistan and the two zero zero three loya jirga afghanistan was referred to by the government of the united states as the transitional islamic state of afghanistan under its new constitution the country is now officially named the islamic republic of afghanistan origin and history of the name the name of afghanistan derives from word afghan the pushtuns appear to have begun using the term afghan as a name for themselves from the islamic period onwards according to w k frazier tyler m c gillet and several other scholars the word afghan first appears in history in the hudud al alam in nine eight two ad there are numerous views regarding the origin of name afghan most of them being purely speculative as can be seen below makhzan i afghni by nematullah written in one six one two ce traces the afghan or pakhtun origin from the super patriarch abraham down to one named king talut or saul it states that saul had a son irmia jeremia who had a son called afghana upon the death of king saul afghana was raised by david and was later promoted to the chief command of the army during the reign of king solomon the progeny of this afghana multiplied numerously and came to be called bani israel in the sixth century bce bakhtunnasar or nebuchadnezzar king of babul attacked judah and exiled the progeny of afghana to ghor located in the center of what is now afghanistan in course of time the exiled community came to be addressed as afghan after the name of their ancestor and the country got its name as afghanistan this traditional view has many historical discrepancies and is therefore not accepted by modern scholarship the last pleader for the bani israel hypothesis being mayor raverty the pathans one nine five eight olaf caroe another version of pushtun legend places afghana the professed eponymous ancestor of the afghans or pushtuns as a contemporary of muslim prophet mohammad on hearing about the new faith of islam qais from aryana travelled to medina to see the muslim prophet muhammad and returned to aryana as a muslim qais abdur rashid purportedly had many sons one of whom was afghana afghana in turn had four sons who set out to the east to establish their separate lineages the first son went to swat the second to lahore and india the third to multan and the last one to quetta this legend is one of many traditional tales amongst the pashtuns regarding their disparate origins again it was this legendary afghana who is stated to have given the pushtuns their current name it is notable that the afghan of this legend is separated from the afghana of solomon s times by at least one one centuries dr h w bellew in his book an enquiry into the ethnography of afghanistan believes that the name afghan derives from the latin term alban used by armenians as alvan or alwan which refers to mountaineers and in the case of transliterated armenian characters would be pronounced as aghvan or aghwan to the persians this would further be altered to aoghan avghan and afghan as a reference to the highlanders or mountaineers of the eastern iranian plateau some people hold that the name derives from abagan i e without god which term the persians are stated to have coined for the pushtuns to describe them as godless or non believers it is claimed that word abagan is antonym of the word bagan believer in god just as word apolitical is antonym of political in the english language there are also a few people who link afghan to an uzbek word avagan said to mean original still others believe that the name derives from sanskrit upa ganah said to mean allied tribes another etymological view is that the name afghan evidently derives from sanskrit ashvaka or ashvakan q v the assakenoi of arrian this view was propounded by j w mccrindle and is supported by numerous modern scholars including c lassen s martin bishop crooks w crooke j c vidyalnar m r singh p smith n l dey dr j l kamboj s kirpal singh and several others in sanskrit word ashva iranian aspa prakrit assa means horse and ashvaka prakrit assaka means horseman pre christian times knew the people of eastern afghanistan as ashvakas horsemen since they raised a fine breed of horses and had a reputation for providing expert cavalrymen the fifth century bce indian grammarian panini calls them ashvayana and ashvakayana classical writers use the respective equivalents aspasios or aspasii hippasii and assakenois or assaceni assacani asscenus the aspasios assakenois ashvakas cavalrymen is stated to be another name for the kambojas because of their equestrian characteristics see list of country name etymologies the last part of the name afghanistan originates from the persian word st n country or land the english word afghanland that appeared in various treaties between qajar persia and the united kingdom dealing with the eastern lands of the persian kingdom modern afghanistan was adopted by the afghans and became afghanistan before being called afghanistan the region had gone through several name changes in its long history of around five zero zero zero years one of the most ancient names according to historians and scholars was ariana the greek pronunciation of the ancient avestan aryanam vaeja or the sanskrit aryavarta land of the aryans today this old persian and avestan expression is preserved in the name iran and it is noted in the name of the afghan national airline ariana airlines the term ariana afghanistan is still popular amongst persian speakers in the country many centuries later afghanistan was part of greater khorasan and hence was recognized with the name khorasan along with regions centered around merv and neishabur which in pahlavi means the eastern land in persian dehkhoda p eight four five seven history afghanistan exists at a unique nexus point where numerous eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity through the ages the region today known as afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples including the aryans medes persians greeks mauryans kushans sassanians arabs turks british and soviets but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region on other occasions native afghan entities have invaded surrounding regions to form empires of their own buddhas of bamiyan dating back to one st century pre islamic afghanistan were the largest buddha statues in the world they were destroyed by the taliban in two zero zero one calling them us islamic photo by hadi zaheer between two zero zero zero and one two zero zero bce waves of indo european speaking aryans are thought to have flooded into modern day afghanistan setting up a nation that became known as ary n m x a ra or land of the aryans zoroastrianism is speculated to have possibly originated in afghanistan between one eight zero zero to eight zero zero bce ancient eastern iranian languages such as avestan may have been spoken in afghanistan around a similar time line with the rise of zoroastrianism around one zero zero zero bce or earlier the indo aryan vedic civilization may have arisen near the vicinity of the kabul valley of eastern afghanistan but this remains speculative as more viable theories based upon archaeological finds tend to support the emergence of the vedic civilization east of the indus and or ganges in what is today pakistan and india by the middle of the six th century bce the persian empire supplanted the medes and incorporated aryana within its boundaries and by three three zero bce alexander the great had invaded the region following alexander s brief occupation the hellenic successor states of the seleucids and bactrians controlled the area while the mauryans from india annexed the southeast for a time and introduced buddhism to the region until the area returned to the bactrian rule during the one st century ce the kushans a tocharian people from central asia with indo european origins occupied the region thereafter aryana fell to a number of eurasian tribes including parthians scythians and huns as well as the sassanian persians and local rulers such as the hindu shahis in kabul until the seven th century ce when muslim arab armies invaded the region the arabs initially annexed parts of western afghanistan in six five two and then conquered most of the rest of afghanistan between seven zero six seven zero nine ce and administered the region as khorasan and over time much of the local population converted to islam but retained their iranian languages afghanistan became the center of various important empires including the ghaznavid empire nine six two one one five one founded by a local turkic ruler from ghazni named yamin ul dawlah mahmud that expanded its suzerainty over a vast area from kurdistan to northern india this empire was replaced by the ghorid empire one one five one one two one nine founded by another local ruler this time of tajik extraction muhammad ghori whose domains included huge parts of central and south asia and laid the foundations for the delhi sultanate in india in one two one nine the region was overrun by the mongols under genghis khan who devastated the land their rule continued with the ilkhanates and was extended further following the invasion of tamerlane timur leng a ruler from central asia by one four zero zero all of afghanistan came under his dominion and he also laid the foundation of another islamic empire in india the mughal empire the uzbek born babur a descendant of both tamerlane and genghis khan established an empire with its capital at kabul by one five zero four and then expanded into south asia in one five two five and established the mughal empire s rule throughout much of what is today pakistan and northern india by one five two seven as the empire shifted eastward the safavids of persia challenged mughal rule while the two superpower empires of the day battled over the fate of afghanistan for decades with the persians acquiring the area by the mid one seven th century local ghilzai pashtun tribesmen lead by khan nashir successfully overthrew safavid rule and under the hotaki dynasty briefly controlled all or parts of persia itself from one seven two two to one seven three six following a brief period under the rule one seven three six one seven four seven of the turko iranian conqueror nadir shah one of his high ranking military officers ahmad shah abdali himself a pashtun tribesman of the abdali clan called for a loya jirga following nadir shah s assassination for which many implicate abdali in one seven four seven the afghans pashtuns came together at kandahar in one seven four seven and chose ahmad shah who changed his last name to durrani meaning pearl of pearls in persian to be king the afghanistan nation state as it is known today came into existence in one seven four seven as the durrani empire and expanded outward from traditional pashtun territories to include all of what is today afghanistan a portion of mashad in iran and all of pakistan and kashmir as well the durrani empire lasted for nearly a century until internecine conflict and wars with the persians and sikhs diminished their empire by the early one nine th century however the current borders of afghanistan would not be determined until the coming of the british during the one nine th century following the anglo afghan wars fought in one eight three nine one eight four two one eight seven eight one eight eight zero and lastly in one nine one nine afghanistan saw much of its territory and autonomy ceded to the united kingdom the united kingdom exercised a great deal of influence and it was not until king amanullah acceded to the throne in one nine one nine see the great game that afghanistan regained complete independence during the period of british intervention in afghanistan ethnic pashtun territories were divided by the durand line and this would lead to strained relations between afghanistan and british india and later the new state of pakistan over what came to be known as the pashtunistan debate the historical rulers of afghanistan were part of the abdali tribe of the ethnic afghans whose name was changed to durrani upon the accession of ahmad shah they belonged to the saddozay segment of the popalzay clan or to the mohammadzay segment of the barakzay clan of the ethnic afghans the mohammadzay frequently furnished the sadozay kings with top counselors who served occasionally as regents and identified with the

series of communist governments that followed was considerable as part of a cold war strategy the us government began to covertly fund and train anti government mujahideen forces through the pakistani secret service agency known as inter services intelligence or isi which were derived from discontented muslims in the country who opposed the official atheism of the marxist regime in one nine seven eight in order to bolster the local communist forces the soviet union citing the one nine seven eight treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries in one nine seven eight intervened on december two four one nine seven nine the soviet occupation resulted in a mass exodus of over five million afghans who moved into refugee camps in neighboring pakistan and iran more than three million alone settled in pakistan faced with mounting international pressure and the loss of approximately one five zero zero zero soviet soldiers as a result of mujahideen opposition forces trained by the united states pakistan and other foreign governments the soviets withdrew ten years later in one nine eight nine for more details see soviet war in afghanistan the soviet withdrawal was seen as an ideological victory in the us which ostensibly had backed the mujahideen in order to counter soviet influence in the vicinity of the oil rich persian gulf following the removal of the soviet forces in one nine eight nine the us and its allies lost interest in afghanistan and did little to help rebuild the war ravaged country the ussr continued to support the regime of dr najubullah formerly the head of the secret service khad until its downfall in one nine nine two however the absence of the soviet forces resulted in the downfall of the government as it steadily lost ground to the guerrilla forces as the vast majority of the elites and intellectuals had either been systematically eliminated by the communists or escaped to take refuge abroad a dangerous leadership vacuum came into existence fighting continued among the various mujahidin factions eventually giving rise to a state of warlordism the chaos and corruption that dominated post soviet afghanistan in turn spawned the rise of the taliban in response to the growing chaos the most serious fighting during this growing civil conflict occurred in one nine nine four

effort is two pronged first it focuses on rebuilding critical physical infrastructure and second on building modern public sector institutions from the remnants of soviet style planning to ones that promote market led development fujimura two zero zero four b but macroeconomic planning and management at present is hampered by poor information weak service delivery systems and less than adequate law enforcement the country has been going through economic recovery since the taliban were overthrown in october two zero zero one however estimating afghanistan s economy is problematic as it is impossible to gather reliable statistics while it is going through a significant change period in all fronts with the added problem of less than ideal security situation the best estimate that can be relied upon is that of the central statistical office in two zero zero three from which the cia factbook seems to have drawn some data accordingly the country s estimated gross domestic product gdp was two one five billion in two zero zero three a two eight six growth over two zero zero two cia factbook two zero zero three among the two three two listed countries in the cia factbook afghanistan ranks one zero eight th in terms of gdp which means per capita income of eight zero zero a brief comparison shows that afghanistan is the poorest country among its neighbors pakistan with a gdp of three four seven billion in two zero zero three had a per capita purchasing power of two two zero zero and iran with its five one seven billion had seven seven zero zero in the north turkmenistan had a gdp of two seven six billion and a per capita income of five seven zero zero uzbekistan with its four eight billion had one eight zero zero and tajikistan despite a low gdp of only eight billion had a per capita income of one one zero zero per head the world bank estimates that afghanistan will remain in need of external financial help before it can stand on its own feet economically ironically afghanistan s gdp ranks approximately at the same level as jordan two five five bn and qatar one nine five bn however considering that those oil rich arab states have smaller populations jordan per capita income amounts to four five zero zero and qatar s to two three two zero zero one of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over two million refugees from neighbouring countries and the west who brought with them fresh energy entrepreneurship and wealth creating skills as well as much needed capital to start up small businesses what is also helping is the estimated two three billion in international assistance the partial recovery of the agricultural sector and the reestablishment of market institutions while the country s current account deficit is largely financed with the donor money only a small portion about one five is provided directly to the government budget the rest is provided to non budgetary expenditure and donor designated projects through the un system and ngos it needs to be mentioned that there are some as yet unconfirmed claims that most of this money is spent on the expenses of the un and other non governmental organizations as well as being funneled into illegitimate activities the government had a central budget of only three five zero million in two zero zero three and an estimated five five zero million in two zero zero four the country s foreign exchange reserves totals about five zero zero million revenue is mostly generated through customs as income and corporate tax bases are negligible inflation had been a major problem until two zero zero two however the depreciation of the afghani in two zero zero two after the introduction of the new notes which replaced one zero zero zero old afghani by one new afghani coupled with the relative stability compared to previous periods has helped prices to stabilize and even decrease between december two zero zero two and february two zero zero three reflecting the turnaround appreciation of the new afghani currency since then the index has indicated stability with a moderate increase toward late two zero zero three fujimura two zero zero four c the afghan government and international donors seem to remain committed to improving access to basic necessities infrastructure development education housing and economic reform the central government is also focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline the rebuilding of the financial sector seems to have been so far successful money can now be transferred in and out of the country via official banking channels and according to accepted international norms a new law on private investment provides three seven year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four year exemption from exports tariffs and duties while these improvements will help rebuild a strong basis for the nation in the future for now the majority of the population continues to suffer from insufficient food clothing housing medical care and other problems exacerbated by military operations and political uncertainties the government is not strong enough to collect customs duties from all the provinces due to the power of the warlords fraud is widespread and corruption is rife within all afghan government organs and central authority is barely felt in the lawless south and south west the economist two zero zero five expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade is another huge problem for the country the cia estimates that one third of the country s gdp comes from opium export although the asian development bank states a lower figure namely two five billion one two of the gdp at any rate this is not only one of kabul s most serious policy and law enforcement challenges but also one of the world s most serious problems the problem began with the soviet invasion in one nine seven nine eight zero as the government began to lose control of provinces warlordism flourished and with it opium production as regional commanders searched for ways to generate money to purchase weapons according to the un at this time the west was pursuing an arms length supporting strategy of the afghan freedom fighters or mujahidin the main purpose being to cripple the ussr slowly into withdrawal rather than a quick and decisive overthrow when the west abandoned afghanistan after its perceived victory over the soviet union as the red army was forced to withdraw in one nine eight nine a power vacuum was created various mujahidin factions started fighting against each other for power with the discontinuation of western support they resorted ever more to poppy cultivation to finance their military existence the regional mafia who were looking for a safe operational hub joined forces with the more fanatic sections of the mujahidin supported by arab extremists like osama bin laden as well as the pakistani secret intelligence service isi to form the taliban movement towards the end of one nine nine four rashid two zero zero zero see also bbc report here the taliban having taken control of nine zero of the country actively encouraged poppy cultivation with this they not only fulfilled their promises and obligations to their partners the regional mafia but also increased their own desperately needed income through taxes according to the above un source afghanistan saw a bumper opium crop of four six zero zero million tonnes in one nine nine nine which was the height of the taliban rule in afghanistan when they came under extreme international diplomatic pressure in two zero zero two they initiated a ban on poppy cultivation following the us led coalition war that led to the defeat of the taliban in november two zero zero one which essentially collapsed the economy the relatively few other sources of revenue forced many of the country s farmers to resort back to growing cash crops for export a notable example of such a crop is the opium poppy one three zero zero km in two zero zero four according to the united nations office on drugs and crime the cultivation of which has largely increased during the last decade afghanistan has become the first illicit opium producer in the world before burma myanmar part of the so called golden triangle the main obstacle to eradicating poppy cultivation in afghanistan is the us forces need for the warlords and their forces in hunting terrorists the warlords are the major culprits in poppy cultivation but are also highly useful to the us forces in scouting providing local intelligence keeping their own territories clean from al qaeda and taliban insurgents and even taking part in military operations all for money this also contributes to the lack of central government s real authority in provinces and discourages farmers from growing grain and fruit as they did for centuries previously in short the afghan economy is currently december two zero zero five going through a hefty change period on the one hand there are encouraging signs of positive development and increasing wealth creation and management but on the other hand the security situation the

part of the pre indo european populace that occupied the coastline of most parts of the mediterranean their physical remains are scarce though and concentrated on the coastal region soon these first inhabitants were overrun by the proto hellenic tribes that gradually occupied modern day greece southern parts of what is now the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and the south of present day albania this process was completed over the second millennium bc and did not really affect northern or central albania an area that at the time presented the image of a political vacuum in essence a historical paradox historians do not agree over the origin of the illyrians some of them maintain that the illyrians descended from the pre indo european pelasgians while most scholars place them in the later wave of indo european invasions their presence can be traced back to nine zero zero bc when their political structure was formulated in the seven th and six th centuries bc excellent metal craftsmen and fierce warriors the illyrians formed warlord based kingdoms that fought amongst themselves for most of their history only during the six th century did the illyrians venture significant raids against their immediate neighbours the kingdom of the molossians in southern albania the kingdom of macedon and the kingdom of paionia besides warfare the illyrians were also peaceful traders of agricultural products and metal works the illyrian culture was heavily influenced by the greek culture mainly the south illyrian tribes albania is also the site of several ancient greek colonies

empire until one nine one two effects of the balkan wars after the second balkan war the ottomans were removed from albania and there was a possibility of the lands being absorbed by serbia and the

often used to refer specifically to the islamic concept of god see usage below etymology usage although outside the arab world use of the word all h is most often associated with islam it is not exclusive to that faith arab christians and various arabic speaking jews including the teimanim several communities and some sephardim also use it to refer to the monotheist deity arabic translations of the bible also employ it as do roman catholics in malta who pronounce it as alla christians in indonesia who say allah bapa god the father and christians in the middle east who use the aramaic all ha allah as a word many linguists believe that the term all h is derived from a contraction of the arabic words al the and il h deity masculine form al il h meaning the god in addition one of the main pagan goddesses of pre islamic arabia all t al il h at or the goddess is cited as being etymologically though not synchronically the feminine linguistic counterpart to the grammatically masculine all h if so the word all h is an abbreviated title meaning the deity rather than a name for this reason both muslim and non muslim scholars often translate all h directly into english as god this also explains why arabic speaking jews and christians freely refer to god as all h however some muslim scholars feel that all h should not be translated because they perceived the arabic word to express the uniqueness of all h more accurately than the word god which can take a plural gods whereas the word all h has no plural form this is a significant issue in translation of the qur an all h written in simple arabic calligraphy the word all h is always written without an alif to spell the vowel this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell however in vocalized spelling a diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate pronunciation one exception is in the pre islamic zabad inscription where it is spelled unicode has glyph reserved for allah u fdf two which can be combined with an alif to yield the post consonantal form as opposed to the full spelling alif l m l m h which may be rendered slightly differently in particular featuring a diacritic alif on top of the shadda in this unicode imitates traditional arabic typesetting which also frequently featured special ll h types also in abjad numerals the name of allah numeric value is six six islamic use of all h from the point of view of traditional islamic theology all h is the most precious name of god because it is not a descriptive name like other ninety nine names of god but the name of god s own presence muslims believe that the name of allah had existed before the time of adam it is the same god worshipped by adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad and other prophets of islam in islam there is only one god and muhammad is the last messenger the emphasis in islamic culture on reciting the qur an in arabic has resulted in all h often being used by muslims world wide as the word for god regardless of their native language out of one one four suras in the qur an one one three begin with the basmala bismi ll hi r rahm ni r rah m which means in the name of god the most kind the most merciful muslims when referring to the name often add the words subhanahu wa ta ala after it meaning glorified and exalted is he as a sign of reverence or azza wa jalla the entire religion of islam is based on the idea of getting closer to god although commonly referred to as a he god is considered genderless but there is no neuter gender to express this in the arabic language when greek or other polytheistic deities are discussed in arabic it is customary to use the expression il h a deity or lower case god sometimes the word ma b d literally meaning worshipped entity is used instead uses of all h in phrases there are many phrases that contain the word all h all hu akbar god is the greatest a uzu billahi minashaitanir rajim i seek refuge in allah from shaitan the damned bismi ll h in the name of god insh all h god willing also the origin of the common spanish interjection ojal which shares a similar meaning probably also the origin of the portuguese interjection oxal let s hope for it or let s hope that y all h oh god may be the origin of the spanish and portuguese exclamation ol m sh all h look at what god has willed subh n all h glory be to god al hamdu li ll h all praise be to god all hu a alam god knows best jazaka all hu khayran may god reward you for your deeds all h appears in a stylized form on the flag of iran in the phrase all hu akbar on the flag of iraq and as part of the shah dah on the flag of saudi arabia allah is not correctly used as a man s name see arabic name mistakes made by europeans and other non arabs islamic concept of god the islamic concept of mankind s place in the universe hinges on the notion that all h or god is the only true reality there is nothing permanent other than him god is considered eternal and uncreated whereas everything else in the universe is created the qur an describes him in sura one one two say he is all h singular all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him have never been one equal see tawhid for more the qur an condemns and mocks the pre islamic arabs for attributing daughters to all h sura five three one nine muslims believe that all h or god is the only true god who deserves to be worshipped this belief must be accompanied by the acknowledgement that mohammad was a true prophet of god who was chosen to guide people to believing and worshipping god in the correct manner god is considered eternal and uncreated with no beginning whereas everything else in the universe is created with a beginning the qur an mentions approximated in english sura one one two say he is all h without partner all h the absolute he begetteth not nor was begotten and to him have never been one equal see tawhid for more god is considered by muslims to be omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient in the qur an god is described as being fully aware of everything that happens in the universe and knows all things god also knows what is in people s hearts and minds at all times it is mentioned in the qur an approximately and he it is who takes your souls at night in sleep and he knows what you acquire in the day then he raises you up therein that an appointed term may be fulfilled then to him is your return then he will inform you of what you were doing sura six six zero placing god inside his creation or suggesting that nature or creation simultaneously co exist in god or vice versa as in other religious traditions completely compromises exclusive islamic monotheism attributing a partner spouse father son daughter mother or other relation s to allah literally or metaphorically partially or completely is considered unquestionably blasphemous by muslims therefore muslims consider it blasphemous to describe jesus or another man woman child etc as son of god whether literally or metaphorically similarly muslims do not believe that god resembles a man old or young woman half man half woman half man half animal bird elephant or other animal or other creation it is forbidden for muslims to view god anthropomorphically allah does not resemble any of his creations in any way whatsoever allah is not attributed with shape colour size position location direction and indeed all of these attributes are found in the creatures allah created further muslims do not believe that allah is located in a place whether on earth below the earth in the sky above the sky on a throne above the sky or all of these places at once or anywhere else or everywhere but rather god exists without a place given he created all places and locations and the perfectness of his existence is not compromised by his existence not being bound to a created by allah place or location god is attributed with complete perfection in his attributes and is free from any defects or any imperfections allah is attributed amongst other attributes with oneness without a partner in god s self or attributes non beginningness eternalness complete freedom from needing others i e each or any of his creations complete power to do all things will to do as he wills as and when god decides without any obstruction knowledge of all things simultaneously past present and future hearing of all sounds without needing any implement or organ to hear sight without needing eyes or any other organ or instrument nor light rays to illuminate an area or an object life unlike the human or other life which is created and limited but that which befits him with no beginning or end speech unlike the human created speech which is constituted of languages letters and sounds but rather an eternal speech which is not a creation but an attribute of god and the complete non resemblence of any creation in his self or attributes history it was used in pre islamic times by pagans within the arabian peninsula to signify the supreme creator pre islamic jews referred to their supreme creator as yahweh or elohim the pagan arabs recognized all h as the supreme god in their pantheon along with allah however the pre islamic arabs believed in a host of other gods such as hubal and daughters of all h the three daughters associated were al l t al uzzah and manah encyclopedia of world mythology and legend the facts on file ed anthony mercatante new york one nine eight three i six one this view of allah by the pre islamic pagans is viewed by muslims as a latter development having arisen as a result of moving away from abrahamic monotheism over time some of the names of these pagan gods are said to be derived from the descendants of noah whom latter generations firstly revered as saints and then transformed into gods although non muslims often view polytheism as having come before monotheism the pagan arabians also used the word all h in the names of their children muhammad s father who was born into pagan society was named abdull h which translates servant of all h abdull h is still used for names of muslim and non muslim arabs the hebrew word for deity el or el ah was used as an old testament synonym for yahweh which is the proper name for the jewish god according to the tanakh the aramaic word for god is al h syriac dialect or el h biblical dialect which comes from the same proto semitic word il h as the arabic and hebrew terms jesus is described in mark one five three four as having used the word on the cross with the ending meaning my when saying my god my god why hast thou forsaken me transliterated in greek as el i one of the earliest surviving translations of the word into a foreign language is in a greek translation of the shahada from eight six nine six ah seven zero five seven one five ad which translates it as ho theos monos literally the one god also the cognate aramaic term appears in the aramaic version of the new testament called the pshitta or peshitta as one of the words jesus used to refer to god e g in the sixth beatitude blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see al ha and in the arabic bible the same words mt five eight other beliefs the nation of gods and earths one of the many sects created as the result of black separatist movements in the united states holds that the word all h is the name of the original black man and stands for arm leg leg arm head this concept is alien to mainstream islam which strictly opposes any attempt to portray all h as a human or in any other way mainstream islam also prohibits attibuting divine qualities to worshipping or glorifying anything other than all h the bah faith whose are primarily written in arabic and farsi also uses allah to mean god though in practice the customary word for god in the local language is typically used when speaking in that language some particular uses are not translated but the arabic phrase is

antarctica the continent of antarctica is located mostly south of the antarctic circle surrounded by the southern ocean antarctica is the southernmost land mass on earth comprising more than one four million km making it the five th largest continent the coastline measures one seven nine six eight km physically antarctica is divided in two by the transantarctic mountains close to the neck between the ross sea and the weddell sea the portion of the continent west of the weddell sea and east of the ross sea is called western antarctica and the remainder eastern antarctica because they correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the greenwich meridian western antarctica is covered by the west antarctic ice sheet about nine eight percent of antarctica is covered by an ice sheet that is on average two five kilometers thick vinson massif the highest peak in antarctica at four eight nine two meters is located in the ellsworth mountains the west antarctic ice sheet has been of recent concern because of the slight possibility of its collapse if it does break down ocean levels would rise by a few meters in a relatively short period of time despite its zero rainfall in some areas the continent has approximately nine zero of the world s fresh water in the form of ice mt erebus an active volcano in ross island although antarctica is home to many volcanoes only deception island and mt erebus are active mount erebus located in ross island is the southernmost active volcano on earth minor eruptions are frequent and lava flow has been observed in recent years other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active in two zero zero four an underwater volcano was found in the antarctic peninsula by american and canadian researchers recent evidence shows this unnamed volcano may be active antarctica is home to more than seven zero lakes that lie thousands of metres under the surface of the continental ice sheet including one under the south pole itself lake vostok discovered beneath russia s vostok station in one nine nine six is the largest of these subglacial lakes it is believed that the lake has been sealed off for three five million years there is some evidence that vostok s waters may contain microbial life due to the lake s similarity to europa a moon of jupiter confirming that life can survive in lake vostok might strengthen the argument for the presence of life on europa geology gondwana breakup more than one seven zero million years ago mya antarctica was part of the supercontinent gondwana africa separated from antarctica around one six zero mya follwed by india in the early cretaceous about one two five mya about six five mya antarctica then still connected to australia had still tropical to subtropical climate complete with a marsupial fauna but by about four five mya australia new guinea had separated from antarctica and the first ice appeared at around two five mya due to the opening of the drake passage between antarctica and south america and the resulting antarctic circumpolar current the ice spread quickly displacing the forests that then covered the continent since about one five mya the continent has been mostly covered with ice climate the blue ice covering lake fryxell in the transantarctic mountains comes from glacial meltwater from the canada glacier and other smaller glaciers antarctica is the coldest place on earth antarctica has little rainfall with the south pole getting none making it a continental desert temperatures reach a minimum of between eight five and nine zero degrees celsius one two one and one three zero degrees fahrenheit in the winter and about three zero degrees higher in the summer months sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over nine zero of the sunlight falling on it eastern antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent leaving the center cold and dry there is little precipitation over the central portion of the continent but ice there can last for extended time periods however heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent where snowfalls of up to one two two meters four eight inches in four eight hours have been recorded at the edge of the continent strong katabatic winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force in the interior however wind speeds are often moderate during summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the south pole than is received at the equator in an equivalent period depending on the latitude long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight mean that climates familiar to humans are not generally available on the continent the aurora australis commonly known as the southern lights is a glow observed in the night sky near the south pole another unique spectacle is diamond dust diamond dust refers to a ground level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies so people sometimes also refer to it as clear sky precipitation a sundog a frequent atmospheric optical phenomenon is a bright spot beside the true sun tabletop icebergs in antarctica population two american researchers studying plankton through microscopes although antarctica has no permanent residents a number of governments maintain permanent research stations throughout the continent the population of persons doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately four

born at the presidente eduardo frei montalva base becoming the first chilean born in antarctica several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station flora and fauna flora more than two zero zero species of lichens are known in antarctica the climate of antarctica does not allow for much vegetation to exist a combination of freezing temperatures soil quality lack of moisture and sunlight limit the chances for plants to exist as a result plant life is limited to mostly mosses and liverworts the autotrophic community is made up of mostly protists the flora of the continent largely consists of lichens bryophytes algae and fungi growth generally occurs in the summer and only for a few weeks at most there are more than two zero zero species of lichens and approximately five zero species of bryophytes such as mosses seven hundred species of algae exist most of which are phytoplankton multicolored snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer there are two species of flowering plants found in the antarctic peninsula antarctic hair grass and antarctic pearlwort fauna emperor penguins in ross sea antarctica land fauna is completely invertebrate such invertebrate life includes microscopic mites lice and springtails the midge just one two mm in size is the largest land animal in antarctica other than man the snow petrel is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in antarctica and have been seen at the south pole a variety of marine animals exist and they rely directly or indirectly on the phytoplankton antarctic sea life includes penguins blue whales and fur seals more specifically the emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in antarctica the ad lie penguin breeds further south than any penguin the rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes one could call them elaborate eyelashes king penguins are also predominant in the antarctic the antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the one eight th and one nine th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the united states and the united kingdom antarctic krill which congregate in large schools is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the southern ocean and is an important food organism for whales seals leopard seals fur seals squid icefish penguins albatrosses and many other birds the approval of the antarctic conservation act brought several restrictions to the continent the introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty as can the extraction of any indigenous species the overfishing of krill which plays a large role in the antarctic ecosystem led officials to enact regulations on fishing the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resources ccamlr a treaty enacted in one nine eight zero requires that regulations managing all southern ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire antarctic ecosystem despite these new acts unregulated and illegal fishing particularly of patagonian toothfish remains a serious problem particularly the illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing with estimates of three

and meteorologists geologists tend to study plate tectonics in the arctic region meteorites from the outer space and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent gondwanaland glaciologists in antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice seasonal snow glaciers and ice sheets biologists in addition to examining the wildlife are interested in how harsh

response to regional warming antarctic meteorite named alh eight four zero zero one from mars meteorites from antarctica are a relatively recent resource for study of the material formed early in the solar system most are thought to come from asteroids but some may have originated on larger planets the first meteorites in antarctica were found in one nine one two in one nine six nine the japanese discovered nine meteorites in antarctica most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last one million years motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on earth the antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved this large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets new types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon and probably mars by impacts these specimens specifically alh eight four zero zero one discovered by ansmet are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on early mars because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic

through most of the one nine nine zero s the menem and de la r a administrations faced diminished competitiveness of exports massive imports which damaged national industry and reduced employment chronic fiscal and trade deficits and the contagion of several economic crises the asian financial crisis in one nine nine eight precipitated an outflow of capital that mushroomed into a recession which led to a total freezing of the bank accounts the corralito and culminated in a financial panic in november two zero zero one the next month amidst bloody riots president de la r a resigned several new presidents followed in quick succession argentina defaulted on its international debt obligations the peso s almost one two year old link with the dollar was abandoned resulting in massive

with the one nine nine zero s emphasis in the relationship with the united states administrative divisions provinces of argentina argentine antarctica and southern atlantic islands two three not shown argentina is divided into two three provinces provincias singular provincia and one autonomous city commonly known as capital federal marked with an asterisk the current official name for the federal district is ciudad aut noma de buenos aires buenos aires has been the capital of argentina since its unification but there have been projects to move the administrative centre elsewhere during the presidency of ra l alfons n a law was passed ordering the move of the federal capital to viedma a city in the patagonic province of r o negro studies were underway when hyperinflation in one nine eight nine killed off the project though the law was never formally repealed it has become a mere historical relic and the project has been forgotten urbanization government house of tucum n about two seven million people live in the autonomous city of buenos aires and roughly one one five million in greater buenos aires two zero zero one making it one of the largest urban conglomerates in the world together with their respective metropolitan areas the second and third largest cities in argentina c rdoba and rosario comprise about one three and one one million inhabitants respectively most european immigrants to argentina coming in great waves especially around the world war i and ii settled in the cities which offered jobs education and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class since the one nine three zero s many rural workers have moved to the big cities the one nine nine zero s saw many rural towns become ghost towns when train services were abandoned and local products manufactured on a small scale were replaced by massive amounts of imported cheap goods in part because of the monetary policy which kept the u s dollar exchange rate fixed and low many slums villas miseria sprouted in the outskirts of the largest cities inhabited by empoverished low class urban dwellers and migrants from smaller towns in the interior of the country however it is important to note that the majority of the people that live in these newly formed small shanty towns are people that came from neighboring countries during the time of convertibility and never left this immigration of humble people from a low socioeconomic status represented an undesirable change because shanty towns and homeless people begging for money was something argentines didn t know until the economic disaster of the one nine nine zero s however the government works actively to try to include these new inmigrants into argentine society and considers their children born in argentina to be argentines there are no plans to build any type of wall to keep these inmigrants out argentina adheres to a policy of allowing anybody who wants to come to argentina to come freely without restrictive inmigration measures in this respect argentina is more progressive than many fully developed countries argentina s urban areas have a european look reflecting the influence of their european settlers many towns and cities are built like spanish cities around a main square called a plaza a cathedral and important government buildings often face the plaza the general layout of the cities is called a damero that is a checkerboard since it is based on a pattern of square blocks though modern developments sometimes depart from it for example the city of la plata built at the end of the one nine th century is organised as a checkerboard plus diagonal avenues at fixed intervals in descending order by number of inhabitants the major cities in argentina are buenos aires c rdoba rosario mendoza la plata tucum n mar del plata salta santa fe and bah a blanca geography map of argentina argentina can roughly be divided into three parts the fertile plains of the pampas in the central part of the country the centre of argentina s agricultural wealth the flat to rolling plateau of patagonia in the southern half down to tierra del fuego and the rugged andes mountain range along the western border with chile with the highest point being the cerro aconcagua at six nine six zero metres two two eight three four ft major rivers include the paraguay bermejo colorado uruguay and the largest river the paran the latter two flow together before meeting the atlantic ocean forming the estuary of the r o de la plata the argentine climate is predominantly temperate with extremes ranging from subtropical in the north to arid sub antarctic in far south enclaves and exclaves there is one argentine exclave the island of mart n garc a co ordinates it is situated near the confluence of the paran and uruguay rivers a mere kilometre zero six two mi inside uruguayan waters about three five kilometres two one mi from the uruguayan coastline near the small city of mart n chico itself about halfway between nueva palmira and colonia del sacramento an agreement reached by argentina and uruguay in one nine seven three reaffirmed argentine jurisdiction over the island ending a century old dispute between the two countries according to the terms of the agreement mart n garc a is to be devoted exclusively to a natural preserve its area is about two square kilometres five zero zero acres and the population about two zero zero people economy subway station in monserrat buenos aires argentina benefits from rich natural resources a highly literate population an export oriented agricultural sector and a diversified industrial base the country historically had a large middle class compared to other latin american countries but this segment of the population was decimated by a succession of economic crises today while a significant segment of the population is still financially well off they stay in sharp contrast with millions who live in poverty or on the brink of it since the late one nine seven zero s the country piled up public debt and was plagued by bouts of high inflation in one nine nine one the government pegged the peso to the u s dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base the government then embarked on a path of trade liberalisation deregulation and privatisation inflation dropped and gdp grew but external economic shocks and failures of the system diluted its benefits causing it to crumble in slow motion from one nine nine five and up to the collapse in two zero zero one by two zero zero two argentina had defaulted on its debt its gdp had shrunk unemployment was over two five the peso had devalued seven five after being floated and inflation was hitting again however careful spending control and heavy taxes on now soaring exports gave the state the tools to regain resources and conduct monetary policy in two zero zero three import substitution policies and soaring exports coupled with a lower inflation and expansive economic measures triggered a surge in the gdp which was repeated in two zero zero four creating jobs and encouraging internal consumption capital flight decreased and foreign investment slowly returned the influx of foreign currency from exports created such a huge trade surplus that the central bank was forced to buy dollars from the market which it continues to do at the time to be accumulated as reserves the situation in two zero zero five is much improved but there are still large numbers of unemployed people that beg for some money or food especially in the outskirts of buenos aires some of them are homeless and there is at least one small non profit humanitarian organisation which distributes free food to some of them most days of the week however the country is still the most developed country in latin america it boasts the highest gdp per capita the highest levels of education measured by university attendance and a reasonable infrastructure that in many aspects is equal in quality to that found in fully industrialized nations in two zero zero two over five seven of the population was below the poverty line at the end of two zero zero five it was three four in two zero zero two unemployement had reached over two five and now it is one zero gdp per capita has surpassed the previous pre recession peek of one nine nine eight it is a very interesting time in argentina because the experts agree that if the country makes the right decisions it could develop and reclaim its previosly held position in the first world so far things are looking good the economy grew eight eight in two zero zero three nine zero in two zero zero four and nine one in two zero zero five the floor is set so that the economy will grow between six zero and seven five in two zero zero six and the government is paying down the foreign debt foreign debt now stands at six nine of gdp and is slowly decreasing the argentine economy has so much untapped potential that if the country manages to encourage the proper level of investment the country could experience growth rates of nine zero for this year and years to come demographics night shot of the colon theatre in buenos aires argentina unlike most of its neighbouring countries argentina s population descends overwhelmingly from europeans the basic demographic stock nine seven of the population is made up of descendants of spanish italian german and other european settlers waves of immigrants from european countries arrived in the late one nine th and early two zero th centuries the patagonian chubut valley has a significant welsh descended population and retains many aspects of welsh culture other important immigrant groups came from germany german colonies were settled in the provinces of entre r os misiones formosa c rdoba and the patagonian region as well as in buenos aires itself france mostly settled in buenos aires city and province scandinavia especially sweden the united kingdom and ireland buenos aires and patagonia and eastern european nations such as poland russia ukraine and the balkans region especially croatia and serbia and others the overwhelming majority of argentina s jewish community numbering about three nine five three seven nine also derives from immigrants of northern and eastern european origin ashkenazi jews it is the largest jewish community in latin america and fifth largest in the world middle eastern immigrants number about five zero zero zero zero zero mainly in urban areas small numbers of people from far east asia have also settled argentina mainly in buenos aires the first asian argentines were of japanese descent but koreans vietnamese and chinese soon followed there are also smaller numbers of people from the indian subcontinent culture european and modern styles in buenos aires argentine culture has been primarily informed and influenced by its european roots buenos aires is undeniably the most european city in south america due both to the prevalence of people of italian spanish and german descent and to conscious imitation argentine cinema has achieved international recognition with films such as the official story and nine queens though it has only rarely been taken into account by mainstream popular viewers who prefer hollywood type movies even low budget productions however have obtained prizes in cinema festivals such as cannes the city of mar del plata organizes its own festival dedicated to this art the best known element of argentine culture is probably their music and dance particularly tango in modern argentina tango music is enjoyed in its own right especially since the radical astor piazzolla redefined the music of carlos gardel it must be noted that while tango refers mostly to a particular dancing music for foreigners the music together with the lyrics often sung in a kind of slang called lunfardo are what most argentines primarily mean by tango tango lyrics can be considered a kind of poetry since the one nine seven zero s rock and roll is also widely appreciated in argentina first during the one nine seven zero s and then again at the mid one nine eight zero s and the beginning of the one nine nine zero s national rock and roll and pop music experienced bursts of popularity with many new bands such as soda stereo and sumo and composers like charly garc a and fito p ez becoming important referents of national culture buenos aires is also considered the techno electronica country in latin america that started with little raves and nowadays is home of important events such as creamfields which has the world record of six five zero zero zero people south american music conference and many more european classical music is well

regional empire with a rich culture in the years leading up to the one st century spanning from the shores of the black sea to the caspian sea and the mediterranean sea during the rule of tigranes the great armenia s strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples including the assyrians persians greeks romans byzantines arabs turks and mongols in ad three zero one armenia became the first country in the world to adopt christianity as its official state religion twelve years before the roman empire granted christianity official toleration under galerius and some three zero four zero years before constantine was baptised there had been various pagan communities before christianity but they were converted by an influx of christian missionaries having changed between various dynasties including parthian iranian roman byzantine arab mongol and persian occupations armenia was substantially weakened in one five zero zero s the ottoman empire and safavid persia divided armenia among themselves in one eight one three and one eight two eight present day armenia consisting of the erivan and karabakh khanates within persia was temporarily incorporated into the russian empire after a short lived independent republic established after the bolshevik revolution in petrograd armenia was incorporated into the ussr between one nine two two and one nine three six it existed as the transcaucasian soviet federated socialist republic with georgia armenia and azerbaijan and from one nine three six to one nine nine one as the armenian ssr during the final years of the ottoman empire one nine one five one nine two two a large proportion of armenians living in anatolia perished as a result of what is termed the armenian genocide regarded by armenians and the vast majority of western historians to have been state sponsored mass killings turkish authorities however maintain that the deaths were a result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine with casualties incurred by both sides most estimates for the number of armenians killed range from six five zero zero zero zero to one five zero zero zero zero zero and these events are traditionally commemorated yearly on april two four armenians and a handful of other countries worldwide have been campaigning for official recognition of the events as genocide for over three zero years but there are also many countries who are pressured not to officially characterize the armenian massacres as genocide armenia remained preoccupied by a long conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh a mostly armenian populated enclave that armenians allege stalin had placed in soviet azerbaijan a military conflict between armenia and azerbaijan began in one nine eight eight and the fighting escalated after both countries gained independence from the soviet union in one nine nine one by may one nine nine four when a cease fire took hold armenian forces controlled not only nagorno karabakh but also the surrounding districts of azerbaijan proper the economies of both countries have been hurt in the absence of a peaceful resolution politics the government of armenia s stated aim is to build a western style parliamentary democracy as the basis of its form of government however international observers have questioned the fairness of armenia s parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referenda since one nine nine five citing polling deficiencies lack of cooperation by the electoral commission and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places for the most part however armenia is considered one of the more pro democratic nations in the commonwealth of independent states the unicameral parliament also called the national assembly is controlled by a coalition of three political parties the conservative republican party the armenian revolutionary federation and the country of law party the main opposition is composed of several smaller parties joined in the justice bloc armenians voted overwhelmingly for independence in a september one nine nine one referendum levon ter petrossian was president until january one nine

no point is below four zero zero metres one three one two ft above sea level mount ararat regarded by the armenians as a symbol of their land is the highest mountain in the region and used to be part of armenia until around one nine one five when it fell to the turks armenia is trying to address its environmental problems it has established a ministry of nature protection and introduced taxes for air and water pollution and solid waste disposal whose revenues are used for environmental protection activities armenia is interested in cooperating with other members of the commonwealth of independent states cis a group of one two former soviet republics and with members of the international community on environmental issues the armenian government is working toward closing its nuclear power plant at medzamor near yerevan as soon as alternative energy sources are identified economy until independence armenia s economy was largely industry based chemicals electronics machinery processed food synthetic rubber and textile and highly dependent on outside resources agriculture contributed only two zero of net material product and one zero of employment before the breakup of the soviet union in one nine nine one armenian mines produce copper zinc gold and lead the vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from russia including gas and nuclear fuel for its one nuclear power plant the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric small amounts of coal gas and petroleum have not yet been developed like other newly independent states of the former soviet union armenia s economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally planned economy and the breakdown of former soviet trading patterns soviet investment in and support of armenian industry has virtually disappeared so that few major enterprises are still able to function in addition the effects of the one nine eight eight spitak earthquake which killed more than two five zero zero zero people and made five zero zero zero zero zero homeless are still being felt the conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh has not been resolved the closure of azerbaijani and turkish borders has devastated the economy because armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials land routes through georgia and iran are inadequate or unreliable gdp fell nearly six zero from one nine eight nine until one nine nine two one nine nine three the national currency the dram suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in one nine nine three nevertheless the government was able to make wide ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth the one nine nine four cease fire in the nagorno karabakh conflict has also helped the economy armenia has had strong economic growth since one nine nine five building on the turnaround that began the previous year and inflation has been negligible for the past several years new sectors such as precious stone processing and jewelry making information and communication technology and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors in the economy such as agriculture this steady economic progress has earned armenia increasing support from international institutions the international monetary fund imf world bank european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd and other international financial institutions ifis and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans loans to armenia since one nine nine three exceed one one billion these loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit stabilizing the currency developing private businesses energy the agriculture food processing transportation and health and education sectors and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone the government joined the world trade organization on february five two zero zero three but one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the armenian diaspora which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects being a growing democratic state armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the western world a liberal foreign investment law was approved in june one nine nine four and a law on privatization was adopted in one nine nine seven as well as a program on state property privatization continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management including increasing revenue collection improving the investment climate and making strides against corruption in the two zero zero six index of economic freedom armenia ranked two seven th best tied with japan and ahead of countries like norway spain portugal and italy

exceeding the three million population of armenia itself with communities existing across the globe including france lebanon and north america the predominant religion in armenia is christianity the roots of the armenian church go back to the one st century ad according to tradition the armenian church was founded by two of jesus twelve apostles thaddaeus and bartholomew who preached christianity in armenia in the four zero s six zero s ad because of these two founding apostles the official name of the armenian church is armenian apostolic church armenia was the first nation to adopt christianity as a state religion in ad three zero one over nine three of armenian christians belong to the armenian apostolic church a form of oriental non chalcedonian orthodoxy which is a very

one a majority of the population are shi a muslim and of western turkic descent known as azerbaijanis or simply azeris the country is formally an emerging democracy however with strong authoritarian rule etymology there are several hypotheses regarding the origins of the name azerbaijan the most common theory is that it is derived from atropatan atropat was the satrap at the time of the persian achaemenid dynasty and gained independence after alexander the great destroyed the achaemenids the region was known as media atropatia or atropatene at the time there are also alternative opinions that the term is a slight turkification of azarbaijan in turn an arabicized version of the original persian name zar b dag n made up of zar badag n zar fire b dag cultivated area n suffix of pluralization that it traditionally means the land of eternal flames or the land of fire which is probabely implies zoroastrian fire temples in this land some azeri historians contend that the name is made up of four azerbaijani components az er bay can which means the land of the brave az people or an elevated place for the wealthy and exalted historically a large part of the territory of the present day azerbaijan republic has been called arran named after arran a legendary founder of caucasian albania however the precise location identified by this name has shifted somewhat over time currently referring to the lowland karabakh plains situated between the kura and araks rivers some opponents of the name azerbaijan assert that it is anachronistic to use it in a historical context before one nine one eight because they say the term was first introduced by the national intelligentsia in early two zero th century and later was endorsed by the bolsheviks with intention of claiming the northern province of persia to substantiate this claim they state that until the early two zero th century the population of present day azerbaijan had no clear ethnic identification and referred to themselves primarily as muslims history main article history of azerbaijan the earliest known inhabitants of what is today azerbaijan were the caucasian albanians a caucasian speaking people who appear to have been in the region prior to the host of peoples who would eventually invade the caucasus historically azerbaijan has been occupied by a variety of peoples including armenians persians romans arabs turks mongols greek empire and russians the first state to emerge in the territory of present day republic of azerbaijan was mannae in the nine th century bc lasting until six one six bc when it was overthrown by the medes the satrapies of atropatene and caucasian albania were established in the four th century bc and included the approximate territories of present day azerbaijan and southern parts of dagestan islam spread rapidly in azerbaijan following the arab conquests in the seven th eight th centuries after the power of the arab khalifate waned several semi independent states have been formed the shirvanshah kingdom being one of them in the one one th century the conquering seljuk turks became the dominant force in azerbaijan and laid the ethnic foundation of

centuries it also underwent a brief period of feudal fragmentation in the mid one eight th to early one nine th centuries and consisted of independent khanates following the two wars between the qajar dynasty of persia and the russian empire azerbaijan was acquired by russia through the treaty of gulistan in one eight one three and the treaty of turkmenchay in one eight two eight after the collapse

commented on these elections human rights watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of prime minister ilham aliev son of current president heidar aliev the government has stacked the central election commission and local election commission with its supporters and banned local non governmental organizations from monitoring the vote as the elections draw nearer government officials have openly sided with the campaign of ilham aliev constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition

astronomy in the us is a hobby whose participants enjoy observing celestial objects it is usually associated with viewing the night sky when most celestial objects and events are visible but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as sunspots and solar eclipses amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable telescopes and binoculars aurora australis display over wellington nz november two zero zero one published by nasa spaceweather com comet neat over wellington nz two zero zero three amateur astronomy and scientific research unlike professional astronomy scientific research is not always the main goal for many amateur astronomers work of scientific merit is certainly possible however and many amateurs contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers very successfully astronomy is often promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection in particular this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers several organisations such as the center for backyard astrophysics exist to help coordinate these contributions in particular amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars helping to track asteroids and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth in the past and present amateur astronomers have also played a major role in discovering new comets recently however funding of projects such as the lincoln near earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them a newer role for amateurs is searching for overlooked phenomena e g kreutz sungrazers in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories much of which is available over the internet societies for amateur astronomy there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy whether they be people who are actively interested in observing or armchair astronomers who may be simply interested in the topic societies range widely in their goals depending on a variety of factors such as geographic spread local circumstances size and membership for instance a local society in the middle of a large city may have regular meetings with speakers focusing less on observing the night sky if the membership is less able to observe due to factors such as light pollution it is common for local societies to hold regular meetings which may include activities such as star parties other activities could include amateur telescope making which was pioneered in america by russell w porter who later played a major role in design and construction of the hale telescope approaches to using amateur telescopes amateur telescopes come in many shapes and sizes both commercial and home built the preferences of people who use them often differ star hopping some amateur astronomers prefer to learn the sky as accurately as they can using maps to find their way between the stars in this case a common approach is to use binoculars or a manually driven telescope combined with star maps to locate items of interest in the sky the normal technique for doing this by locating landmark stars and hopping between them is called star hopping goto telescopes more recently as technology has improved and prices have come down automated goto telescopes have also become a popular choice with these computer driven telescopes the user typically enters the name of the item they wish to look at and the telescope finds it in the sky automatically with comparatively little further effort required by the user the main advantage of a goto telescope for an experienced amateur astronomer is the reduction of wasted time that may have otherwise been used in trying to find a particular object this time can therefore be used more effectively for studying the object comparing methodologies there is significant though usually light hearted debate within the hobby about which method is better promoters of the star hopping approach for finding items in the sky usually argue that they know the sky much better as a result the manual method also tends to require simpler equipment with less calibration and setup time and is therefore more versatile promoters of goto telescopes often argue that they are more interested in studying objects and the reward of finding them or learning exactly where they are is not as important to them it may also be argued that the money spent on complex electronics and mounting systems might be better spent on higher quality optics additional tools and activities in addition to optical equipment amateur astronomers use a variety of other tools such as celestial maps and specialised computer software there is a range of astronomy software available from planetarium programs that simulate the sky to programs used to do various kinds of calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena most amateur astronomers also keep a record of their observations this can take the form of an observing log in which they record details about which objects were observed and describing the details that were seen astrophotography and sketching are also popularly used to record observations beginning in amateur astronomy there are a many ways for people to become involved in amateur astronomy and study the night sky one option is to join a local astronomical society the members of which will often be very happy to help a newcomer take a more active part some people also prefer to simply teach themselves in which case there are likely to be a large amount of books in the local library common objects that are observed early are the moon and planets another thing that most newcomers to amateur astronomy become acquainted with are the more prominent constellations in the night sky when reading maps and interpreting instructions for future star hopping constellations are good starting points for identifying locations in the night sky they are frequently referred to by amateur astronomers when discussing the location of items of interest when looked at with binoculars and telescopes beginning with a goto telescope a relatively new type of beginning amateur astronomer brought about by the increased affordability of powerful goto telescopes is one who begins with such a telescope it is possible for an inexperienced person to immediately look at a large amount of deep sky objects in the night sky without necessarily having any prior experience or training there is currently some debate among amateur astronomers about the merits of this approach to becoming involved in the hobby and the effects that low priced goto telescopes may be having amateur astronomy is exposed to more people as an individual is less likely to be discouraged by the need to learn how to locate objects in the night sky before being able to see them some are concerned however that newcomers may become bored very quickly a goto telescope does not distinguish between objects that are easy and hard to see and newcomers may therefore begin with objects that require large amounts of experience or understanding to properly appreciate becoming acquainted with the night sky most tutors agree that it is very important to know one s way around the sky by means of the constellations this ability forms a platform from which deeper explorations of the sky are then possible a planisphere can be used to find and identify the constellations these devises show the location of the constellations for any time of the night or time of the year an observer will also need a red flashlight to read star charts or the planisphere use of a red light helps preserve the dark adaptation of the eyes having learned the main constellations a beginner may want to extend their hobby and buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope using binoculars with binoculars it is possible to see many deep sky objects dsos holding the binoculars can produce a shaky image one way to improve the view is with the aid of a sturdy tripod mount to steady the view through the binoculars binoculars are still limited in range although most of the messier catalogue should be visible as well as a great many ngc s especially near the milky way an advantage of binoculars is that they allow more complete wide field views of the larger open clusters such as the pleiades the hyades the coma berenices cluster and praesepe for example of which only portions are usually observable in one field of view at higher magnifications using a telescope with a telescope the sky really comes alive especially one that has an aperture of six inches or more some amateur telescopes are built by their owners from scratch but many good quality telescopes can be purchased from reputable companies thousands of dsos are visible in a telescope and the determined amateur with a large about four one cm telescope can push this to tens of thousands or more another type of telescope to consider especially if the amateur is observing with children is a wide field telescope such as edmund scientific s f four astroscan compact reflector this type of telescope is typically a short tube reflector and has an aperture of only eight zero to one two zero mm three one four to four three four inches but is easier to target an object since it offers a much wider field of view with the aid of high power lenses i e eyepieces the amateur can zoom in on planets and some of the closer dsos it is the best of a blend of a telescope s narrow long range light gathering ability with a binocular s wider field of view those who are particularly interested in observing the moon and planets may prefer a high power design such as the maksutov telescope with any telescope though the mount is the most important feature a tripod that doesn t shake every time one uses it is a must too many amateur astronomers give up because they have a hard time targeting an object if the mounting tripod is rock solid the amateur can enjoy their time observing the heavens instead of fighting with the telescope astrophotography a photo taken of comet hale bopp using a standard three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens and four zero zero iso film the exposure was taken for one zero seconds on a tripod using a shutter cable release the next step in an amateur astronomer s quest for more space adventure could be the purchase of a good camera for astrophotography starting out with a good three five mm camera with a five zero mm lens mounted on a tripod and using a cable release and four zero zero or faster speed film the amateur can capture some nice pictures of the planets and some larger nebula like the orion nebula some of the larger comets and prolific meteor showers can be photographed this way as well as one progresses cameras can be mounted directly on to telescopes capturing on film many dsos special films and even the technique of hypering the film has been employed by the amateur many publications accept these astrophotos in their magazines i e astronomy and sky telescope a more recent development is the use of webcams to do speckle imaging also known as video astronomy the resulting short exposure frames can be stacked using the shift and add method of speckle imaging or selected to do lucky imaging all using commercially available astronomy software sketching as an alternative to photography in order to make a record of observations amateurs also use sketching sketching does not require the use of any specialized equipment and is therefore suitable for beginners as well as advanced amateur observers there are different approaches to sketching that require different tools simple pencil sketches can sometimes be used to make accurate renditions of what the observer sees through binoculars or a telescope as the expewrience of the observer increases more advanced drawing tools and techniques can be employed sketching has the advantage of helping the observer scrutinize the object that is seen and can help bring out details that otherwise might have been overlooked

of kanji literally meaning joining energy way is a gendai budo a modern japanese martial art practitioners of aikido are known as aikidoka it was developed by morihei ueshiba also known by aikidoka as o sensei over the period of the one nine three zero s to the one nine six zero s technically the major parts of aikido are derived from dait ry aiki j jutsu a form of jujutsu with many joint techniques and kenjutsu or japanese sword technique some believe the tactics in aikido are especially influenced by yagy shinkage ry aikido is also considered to contain a significant spiritual component history the name aikido is formed of three japanese characters usually romanised as ai ki and do these are often translated as meaning union universal energy and way so aikido can be translated as the way to union with universal energy another common interpretation of the characters is harmony spirit and way so aikido can also mean the way of spiritual harmony both interpretations draw attention to the fact that aikido s techniques are designed to control an attacker by controlling and redirecting their energy instead of blocking it an analogy is often made of the way a flexible willow bends with the storm whereas the stout oak will break if the wind blows too hard the korean martial art commonly known as hapkido uses the same three characters some suggest a historical link through daito ryu the main origin of aikido morihei ueshiba developed aikido mainly from daito ryu aikijutsu incorporating training movements such as those for the yari spear jo a short quarterstaff and perhaps also juken bayonet but arguably the strongest influence is that of the katana sword in many ways an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman the aikido strikes shomenuchi and yokomenuchi originated from weapon attacks and resultant techniques likewise from weapon take aways some schools of aikido do no weapons training at all others such as iwama ryu usually spend substantial time with bokken bokuto wooden sword jo and tanto knife in some lines of aikido all techniques can be performed with a sword as well as unarmed aikido was first brought to the west in one nine five one by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france it was introduced to the united states in one nine five three by kenji tomiki and a little later in the same year by koichi tohei the united kingdom followed in one nine five five germany and australia in one nine six five today there are many aikido dojos available to train at throughout the world technique aikido incorporates a wide range of techniques which use principles of energy and motion to redirect neutralise and control attackers one of the central martial philosophies of aikido is to be able to handle multiple attacker circumstances fluidly randori practice against multiple opponents is a key part of the curriculum in most aikido schools and is required for the higher level belts another tenet of aikido is that the aikidoka should gain control of their opponent as quickly as possible while causing the least amount of damage possible to either party if performed correctly size and strength are not important for the techniques to be effective training the methods of training vary from organisation to organisation and indeed even between different dojo in a single organisation typically however a class consists of a teacher demonstrating techniques or principles which the students then practice training is done through mutual technique where the focus is on entering and blending harmonising with the attack rather than on meeting force with force uke the receiver of the technique usually initiates an attack against nage also referred to as tori or shite depending on aikido style who neutralises it with an aikido technique the uke and the nage have equally important roles uke s role is to be honest and committed in attack to use positioning to protect oneself and to learn proper technique through the imbalanced feeling created by nage s technique nage s role is to blend with and neutralise uke s attack without leaving an opening to further attacks simultaneously nage will be studying how to create a feeling of being centred on balance and controlled in the application of the aikido technique therefore students must practise both positions in order to learn proper technique when o sensei taught all his students were uke until he deemed them knowledgeable enough of the technique to be nage movement awareness precision distance and timing are all important to the execution of techniques as students progress from rigidly defined exercises to more fluid and adaptable applications eventually students take part in jiyu waza free attack and or randori where the attacks are less predictable most schools employ training methods wherein uke actively attempts to employ counter techniques or kaeshi waza o sensei did not allow competition in training because some techniques were considered too dangerous and because he believed that competition did not develop good character in students most styles of aikido continue this tradition although shodokan aikido see styles started with competitions early on in the ki society there are forms taigi competitions held from time to time defense aikido techniques are largely designed towards keeping the attacker off balance and locking joints much of aikido s repertoire of defenses can be performed either as throwing techniques nage waza or as pins katame waza depending on the situation entering irimi and turning tenkan are widely used aikido concepts as is striking atemi the use of striking techniques is dependent on the organization and to some extent the individual dojo some dojo teach the strikes that are integral to all aikido techniques as mere distractions used to make the application of an aikido technique easier while others teach that strikes are to be used for more destructive reasons o sensei himself wrote while describing the aikido technique ikkyo first smash the eyes this might well refer to the fact that the classic opener for ikkyo is a knife hand thrust towards the face to make uke block and thus expose his or her arm to the joint control thus as though moving to smash uke s eyes manipulation of uke s balance by entering is often referred to as taking uke s center it is sometimes said that aikido contains only defense and the attacks that are performed are not really aikido from a historical perspective this claim is questionable but many if not most aikidoka have the defense techniques as the focus of their training attacks in the early days when ueshiba began teaching to the public students tended to be proficient in another martial art due to this attacks per se are generally not focused on in contemporary aikido dojos students will learn the various attacks from which an aikido technique can be practiced although attacks seldom are studied to the same extent as some arts good attacks are needed to study correct and effective application of technique honest attacks are considered important an honest attack would be an attack with full intention or a strong neutral neither pulling or pushing grab or hold the speed of an attack may vary depending on the experience and level of the nage the partner who executes the throw or technique whether the attack is fast or slow the uke s intention to strike or control if grabbing or pinning should remain in order to provide the nage a realistic training scenario aikido attacks used in normal training include various stylized strikes and grabs such as shomenuchi a vertical strike to the head yokomenuchi a lateral strike to the side of the head and or neck munetsuki a straight punch ryotedori a two handed grab or katadori a shoulder grab many of the uchi strikes resemble blows from a sword or other weapon kicks are sometimes used but are not usually part of basic curricula most aikido techniques can also be applied to a response to an attack e g to a block and some schools use this as the basic form of a given class of technique beginners also tend to work with techniques executed in response to a grab grabs are considered good for basic practice because the connection with uke is very clear and strong and it is easier to feel out body mechanics and lines of force there is also the matter of atemi or strikes employed during an aikido technique the role and importance of atemi is a matter of some debate in aikido some view atemi as strikes to vital points that can be delivered during the course of a technique s application to increase effectiveness others consider atemi to be methods of distraction particularly when aimed at the face for instance if a movement would expose the aikido practitioner to a counter blow he or she may deliver a quick strike to distract the attacker or occupy the threatening limb such a strike will also usually break the target s concentration making them easier to throw than if they are able to focus on resisting atemi can be interpreted as not only punches or kicks but also for instance striking with a shoulder or a large part of the arm some throws are arguably effected through an unbalancing or abrupt application of atemi many sayings about atemi are attributed to morihei ueshiba although their precise content varies considerably based on the one doing the telling weapons weapons training in aikido usually consists of jo four foot staff bokken wooden sword and wooden or sometimes rubber tanto knife both weapons taking and weapons retention are sometimes taught to integrate the armed and unarmed aspects of aikido for example a technique done with a straight punch may be done with a tanto or jo thrust instead or a grab technique may be illustrated as a way to draw strike with a weapon while being grabbed many schools use versions of morihiro saito s weapons system aiki jo and aiki ken the system contains solo kata with jo and paired exercises for both jo and bokken some lineages use bokken kata derived from older sword schools also quite a few aikido teachers such as mitsugi saotome and kazuo chiba have developed their own weapons systems this is largely due to the fact that o sensei did not teach weapons to his students excepting a few clothing the aikidogi used in aikido is similar to the keikogi used in most other modern budo arts simple trousers and a wraparound jacket usually white in some places a keikogi of karate cut is preferred in others most people use judo keikogis keikogi made specially for aikido exist but usually not in the lower price ranges many dojos insist that the sleeves are cut short to elbow length to reduce the risk of trapped fingers and injuries in grab techniques to the wrist to the keikogi adds the traditional garment hakama wide pleated trousers the hakama is usually black or dark blue and in most dojos the hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan black belt ranks systems also exist where hakama is never worn or are worn from a specific kyu rank others exist where women are allowed to wear it earlier than men the belt obi is wrapped twice around the body similar to in karate or judo although some systems use many belt colours similar to the system in judo the most common version is that dan ranks wear black belt and kyu ranks white sometimes with an additional brown belt for the highest kyu ranks in some dojos it is common to have the same color belt at different levels spirituality the ending do in the word aikido indicates a spiritual path unlike the ending jutsu in the word aikijujutsu which indicates a system of techniques many people see this difference as important as well as regarding iaijutsu and iaido jujutsu and judo and kenjutsu and kendo others see this distinction as a historically incorrect and somewhat unnatural division for example literally do refers to a path and jitsu to a technique therefore some argue aikido involves both a way do and technical study jutsu ueshiba taught that while it was important to become proficient in physical technique this is not the ultimate purpose of training he taught that the principles learned through training in physical technique are universal and are to be applied to all aspects of one s life he once commented that he was teaching students not how to move their feet but rather how to move their minds many agree that ueshiba s style became softer more fluid and effortless as he grew older some suggest this was due to a shift in focus to the spiritual aspects of the art while others suggest that this was simply a natural result of ueshiba becoming more proficient in physical technique various interpretations have arisen since ueshiba s death a range of aikido schools can be found each placing a different emphasis on physical techniques underlying principles and spiritual concepts this is largely a result of at what point the founder of each of these schools trained with ueshiba earlier or later in ueshiba s life the former tend to focus more on physical technique while the latter tend to focus more on spiritual concepts however this should not be overstated especially since there is considerable variance from sensei to sensei and an aikido continuum is quite problematic to actually construct some aikidoka view physical vs spiritual as a false separation or a failed attempt to stereotype branches of aikido ki society is an example of a school that focuses heavily on the spiritual concepts of aikido rather than physical technique ki obsolete form of the ki kanji the japanese character for ki is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice the steam being contained within is ki this same word is applied to the ability to harness one s own breath power power or energy this ki is the same as the qi in qi gong but many people argue it is not the same as the chi in t ai chi when aikidoka say that someone is training with a lot of ki they usually want to express that the person is very non forcefully compelling in the execution of his technique timing a sense for the correct distance and a centered undisturbed mind and body are particularly important most teachers claim to locate ki in the hara which might be loosely defined as the body s center of gravity situated in the lower abdomen about two inches below and behind the navel in training it is constantly emphasized that one should keep one s hara that is remain centered very high ranking teachers sometimes reach a level of coordination that enables them to execute techniques with very little apparent movement sometimes even without seeming to touch their opponent s body essentially ki corresponds to the physical concepts of center of gravity center of momentum and center of force however these centers are not necessarily the same so ki also encompasses the biological and mental aspect of training oneself to have exquisite control over motion the spiritual interpretation of ki depends very much on what school of aikido one studies as some emphasize it more than others ki society dojos for example tend to spend much more time on ki related training activities than do for example yoshinkan dojos the importance of ki in aikido cannot be denied the name of the martial art after all can be translated as the meeting of ki but what ki is is debated by many within the discipline o sensei himself appears to have changed his views over time for example yoshinkan aikido which largely follows o sensei s teachings from before the war is considerably more martial in nature reflecting a younger more violent and less spiritual o sensei within this school ki perhaps could be better thought of as having its original chinese meaning of breath and aikido as coordination of movement with breath to maximize power as o sensei evolved and his views changed his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel and many of his later students almost all now high ranking senseis within the aikikai teach about ki from this perspective see also qi qigong body aikido training is for all around physical fitness flexibility and relaxation the human body in general can exert power in two ways contractive and expansive aikidofaq com many fitness activities for example weight lifting emphasize the former which means that specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone mass and power the disadvantage of this however is that whole body movement and coordination are rarely stressed thus while muscle size and power may increase there is no emphasis on the ways in which those muscles can work together most efficiently also this sort of training tends to increase tension decrease flexibility and stress the joints the result may be aesthetically pleasing but when done to excess may actually be detrimental to overall health the second type of power expansive is mostly stressed in activities such as dance or gymnastics in these activities the body must learn to move in a coordinated manner and with relaxation aikido also mostly stresses this sort of training while both types of power are important it is interesting to note that a person who masters the second type of power can in a martial context often overcome a person who is much bigger or stronger the reason for this is that the contractive power is only as great as the mass and power of your individual muscles expansive power however as used in aikido can be much greater than your size may lead you to believe this is because you move with your whole body rather than stressing and tensing only a few muscles you learn to relax and move from the center of your body where you are most powerful power is then extended out naturally through the relaxed limbs which become almost whip like in their motion needless to say the power behind an entire person s body will be more than that of someone s arm or leg alone hence aikido develops the body in a unique manner aerobic fitness is obtained through vigorous training flexibility of the joints and connective tissues is developed through various stretching exercises and through the techniques themselves relaxation is learned automatically since without it the techniques will not function a balanced use of contractive and expansive power is mastered enabling even a small person to pit his entire body s energy against their opponent with this different masters stress different aspects of training some masters stress importance of body posture while executing the technique in order to coordinate different parts of the body while others deal with the physical aspects of it with each way comes a different means of interpretation of the same basic principles of the art which is discussed in more detail above mind aikido training does not consider the body and mind as independent entities the condition of one affects the other for example the physical relaxation learned in aikido also becomes a mental relaxation likewise the confidence that develops mentally is manifested in a more confident style psychological or spiritual insight learned during training must become reflected in the body else it will vanish under pressure when more basic ingrained patterns and reflexes take over aikido training requires the student to squarely face conflict not to run away from it through this experience an aikido student may learn to face other areas of life in a similarly proactive fashion rather than in with avoidance and fear styles the major styles of aikido each have their own hombu dojo in japan have an international breadth and were founded by direct students of morihei ueshiba although there has been an explosion of independent styles generally only the first five listed have been considered major iwama ryu is a debatable sixth as although its influence is major it has until recently been part of the aikikai see below aikikai is the largest aikido organisation and is led by the family of the founder numerous sub organisations and teachers affiliate themselves with this umbrella organisation which therefore encompasses a wide variety of aikido styles training methods and technical differences these sub organisations are often centred around prominant shihan and are usually organised at the national level although sub national and inter national sub organisations exist please see list of famous aikidoka for more detail yoshinkan founded by gozo shioda has a reputation for being the most rigidly precise students of yoshinkan aikido practise basic movements as solo kata and this style has been popular among the japanese police the international organization associated with the yoshinkan style of aikido is known as the yoshinkai and has active branches in many parts of the world yoseikan was founded by minoru mochizuki who was an early student of o sensei and also of jigoro kano at the kodokan this style includes elements of aiki budo together with aspects of karate judo and other arts it is now carried on by his son hiroo mochizuki the creator of yoseikan budo shodokan aikido often called tomiki aikido after its founder use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others people tend to compete to train rather than to train to compete kenji tomiki an early student of o sensei and also of judo s jigoro kano believed that introducing an element of competition would serve to sharpen and focus the practice since it was no longer tested in real combat this latter view was the cause of a split with o sensei s family who firmly believed that there was no place for competition in aikido training tomiki said that at no point did o sensei actually cast him out the ki society founded by former head instructor of the hombu dojo one zero th dan koichi tohei emphasizes very soft flowing techniques and has a special program for the development of ki it also has a special system of ki ranks alongside the traditional kyu and dan system this style is called shin shin toitsu aikido or ki aikido iwama ryu emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques and a great deal of emphasis is placed on weapons training since the death of its founder morihiro saito the iwama style has been practiced by clubs within the aikikai and an independent organization headed by hitohiro saito saito sensei was a long time uchideshi of o sensei beginning in one nine four six and staying with him through his death many consider that saito sensei was the student who spent most time directly studying with o sensei saito sensei said he was trying to preserve and teach the art exactly as the founder of aikido taught it to him technically iwama ryu seems to resemble the aikido o sensei was teaching in the early five zero s mainly in the iwama dojo the technical repertoire is fairly large the new separate from aikikai iwama ryu aikido has been renamed iwama shin shin aikishurenkai shin ei taido founded by the late noriaki inoue nephew of morihei ueshiba yoshokai aikido begun by then hachidan takashi kushida of yoshinkan aikido is a remarkably centralized style of aikido with test techniques yearly passed down with explanations from the home dojo the syllabus contains a considerable amount of weapons study and like yoshinkan yoshokai includes many solo movements and exercises doshinkan aikido begun by yukio utada of yoshinkan aikido utada was a student of both the yoshinkan founder gozo shioda and yoshokai founder takashi kushida like yoshokai the syllabus also contains a considerable amount of weapons study and like yoshinkan doshinkan includes many solo movements and exercises doshinkan aikido aikido association of north america and doshinkan aikido international is still affiliated with the international yoshinkan aikido federation tendoryu aikido headed by kenji shimizu shin budo kai headed by shizuo imaizumi kokikai aikido founded by shuji maruyama in one nine eight six focuses on minimalist but effective technique it emphasizes natural stances and ukemi that do not require high breakfalls and deemphasizes atemi and techniques that cause pain or undue discomfort to uke as such it is considered by some to be a soft style of aikido seidokan aikido founded by rod kobayashi tends to utilize movements which are very small and economical encourages students to discover an aikido which is truly their own stresses the importance of doing away with the extraneous and focusing on that which works nippon kan headed by gaku homma nishio aikido a part of the aikikai although techically well defined according to its head shoji nishio nishio sensei passed away in march two zero zero five nihon goshin aikido headed by richard bowe it is considered a hard style of aikido combining techniques from karate judo and daito ryu aikijutsu there are roughly a dozen dojos in the united states

large but loose collection of essays multimedia and humour aikido journal website the most comprehensive source of aikido historical information aikido japanese martial arts winged victory of samothrace exihibited in the louvre by its original and broadest definition art from the latin ars meaning skill or craft is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge and a set of skills this meaning is preserved in such phrases as liberal arts and martial arts however in the modern use of the word which rose to prominence during the renaissance art is commonly understood to be the process or result of making material works or artwork which from concept to creation adhere to the creative impulse that is art is distinguished from other works by being in large part unprompted by necessity by biological drive or by any undisciplined pursuit of recreation by both definitions of the word artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art the creative arts are a collection of disciplines whose principal purpose is in the output of material that is compelled by a personal drive and echoes or reflects a message mood and symbolism for the viewer to interpret as such the term art may be taken to include forms as diverse as prose writing poetry dance acting music sculpture and painting in addition to serving as a method of pure creativity and self expression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically religiously and philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics and fine art or pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent as a form of cultural expression art may be defined by the pursuit of diversity and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration i e art history art criticism and art theory to mediate its boundaries this distinction may be applied to objects or performances current or historical and its prestige extends to those who made found exhibit or own them other than originality there are no widely agreed upon criteria for what is or isn t considered art and there are many divergent definitions of art to seek more specific requirements etymology the word art derives from the latin ars which roughly translates to skill or craft and derives in turn from an indo european root meaning arrangement or to arrange this is the only near universal definition of art that whatever is described as such has undergone a deliberate process of arrangement by an agent a few examples where this meaning proves very broad include artifact artificial artifice artillery medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymological roots art forms there are a variety of arts including visual arts and design decorative arts plastic arts and the performing arts artistic expression takes many forms painting drawing printmaking sculpture music literature and architecture are the most widely recognised forms however since the advent of modernism and the technological revolution new forms have emerged these include photography film video art installation art conceptual art performance art community arts land art fashion comics computer art anime and most recently video games within each form a wide range of genres may exist for instance a painting may be a still life a portrait or a landscape and may deal with historical or domestic subjects in addition a work of art may be representational or abstract most forms of art fit under two main categories fine arts and applied arts though there is no clear dividing line in the visual arts the term fine arts most often refers to painting and sculpture arts which have little or no practical function and are valued in terms of the visual pleasure they provide or their success in communicating ideas or feelings other visual arts typically designated as fine arts include printmaking drawing photography film and video though the tools used to realize these media are often used to make applied or commercial art as well architecture typically confounds the distinctions between fine and applied art since the form involves designing structures that strive to be both attractive and functional the term applied arts is most often used to describe the design or decoration of functional objects to make them visually pleasing artists who create applied arts or crafts are usually referred to as designers artisans or craftspeople defining art there is often confusion about the meaning of the term art because multiple meanings of the word are used interchangeably individuals use the word art to identify painting as well as singing characteristics of art there follow some generally accepted characteristics of art after this there is some lengthier discussion of several of those facets perceived as universal or central to art encourages an intuitive understanding rather than a rational understanding as for example with an article in a scientific journal was created with the intention of evoking such an understanding or an attempt at such an understanding in the audience was created with no other purpose or function other than to be itself a radical pure art definition elusive in that the work may communicate on many different levels of appreciation one may take the example of gericault s raft of the medusa in the case of which special knowledge concerning the shipwreck the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it but allows the appreciation of gericault s political intentions in the piece in relation to the above the piece may offer itself to many different interpretations or though it superficially depicts a mundane event or object invites reflection upon elevated themes demonstrates a high level of ability or fluency within a medium this characteristic might be considered a point of contention since many modern artists most notably conceptual artists do not themselves create the works they conceive or do not even create the work in a conventional demonstrative sense one might think of tracey emin s controversial my bed the conferral of a particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structure or form upon an original set of unrelated passive constituents skill art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium an example of this is the contemporary young master josignacio creator of plastic paint medium it can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language so as to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth a common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability such as one might find in many works of the rennaissance or in the plays of shakespeare or an originality in stylistic approach or a combination of these two for example a common contemporary criticism of some modern painting occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object one might take tracey emin s my bed or hirst s the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living as examples of pieces wherein the artist exercised little to no traditionally recognised sets of skills in the first case emin simply slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in a gallery she has however been insistent that there is a high degree of selection and arrangement in this work which includes objects such as underwear and bottles around the bed in the second case hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork although he physically particpated in the creation of this piece he has left the eventual creation of many other works to employed artisans these approaches are exemplary of a particular kind of contemporary art conceptual art the exclusionary view that art requires a certain skill level to produce is often described as a lay critique it derives from the fact that in western culture at least art has traditionally been pushed in the direction of representationalism the literal presentation of reality through literal images on the other hand criticism has often been brought to bear on modern artists for having no creative involvement whatsoever in their creations one might take hirst s work again as emblematic of this approach it may be further noted that certain forms of art outside a western tradition such as islamic geometric designs and calligraphy buddhist or hindu mandalas and celtic knotwork though they are non representational still require a measure of skill and certain creative involvement in their execution judgments of value somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art whether it is perceived to be attractive or repellent though perception is always colored by experience and thus a reaction to art on these grounds is necessarily subjective it is commonly taken that that which is not aesthetically satisfying in some fashion cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers in other words an artist s prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic and art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought provoking reasons for example francisco goya s painting depicting the spanish shootings of three rd of may one eight zero eight is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya s keen artistic ability in composition and execution and his fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of that which is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that in the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium in order to strike some universal chord or by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist communicating emotion art appeals to human emotions it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings artists have to express themselves so that their public is aroused but they do not have to do so consciously art explores what is commonly termed as the human condition that is essentially what it is to be human and art of a superior kind often brings about some new insight concerning humanity not always positive or demonstrates a level of skill so fine as to push forward the boundaries of collective human ability this is not to say that technical skill is a necessary prerequisite of art but rather that a high degree of skill goes some way in conferring a judgement of high standard upon an artist or artwork creative impulse from one perspective art is a generic term for any product of the creative impulse out of which sprang all other human pursuits such as science via alchemy and religion via shamanism the term art offers no true definition besides those based within the cultural historical and geographical context in which it is applied though to the artists themselves the impulse to create is undeniable an artist can no more deny that impulse than he she could ignore breathing one might compare kandinsky s inner necessity to this popular view it is because of the overbearing need to create in the face of financial ruin public obscurity or political opposition that artists are typically conceived of as unstable even crazy or misguided differences in defining art definitions of art and aesthetic arguments usually proceed from one of several possible perspectives art may be defined by the intention of the artist as in the writings of dewey art may be seen as being in the response emotion of the viewer as tolstoy claims in danto s view it can be defined as a character of the item itself or as a function of an object s context plato for plato art is a pursuit whose adherents are not to be trusted given that their productions imitate the sensory world itself an imitation of the divine world of forms art necessarily is an imitation of an imitation and thus is hopelessly far from the source of the truth plato it may be noted barred artists from access to his ideal city in his republic aristotle aristotle saw art in less of a bad light though he shared plato s poor opinion of it he nevertheless thought that art might serve the purpose of emotional catharsis that is by witnessing the sufferings and celebrations of actors onstage onlookers might vicariously experience these same feelings themselves and thereby purge such negative feelings institutional definition many people s opinions of what art is would fall inside a relatively small range of accepted standards or institutional definition of art george dickie one nine seven four this derives from education and other social factors most people did not consider the depiction of a brillo box or a store bought urinal to be art until andy warhol and marcel duchamp respectively placed them in the context of art i e the art gallery which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art although strictly speaking warhol s artwork was not an actual brillo box but an exact replica of one so it met the traditional criterion of skill at the very least most viewers of these objects initially rejected such associations because the objects did not themselves meet the accepted criteria the objects needed to be absorbed into the general consensus of what art is before they achieved the near universal acceptance as art in the contemporary era once accepted and viewed with a fresh eye the smooth white surfaces of duchamp s urinal are strikingly similar to classical marble sculptural forms whether the artist intended it or not this type of recontextualizing provides the same spark of connection expected from any traditionally created art it should be noted however that duchamps act might be as readily interpreted as a demonstration of the not always beneficial power of artistic institutions rather than the universal art potentially inherent in all objects the placement of an object in an artistic context is not taken as a universal standard of art but is a common characteristic of conceptual art prevalent since the one nine six zero s notably the stuckist art movement criticises this tendency of recent art related issues social criticism art is often seen as belonging to one social class and excluding others in this context art is seen as a high status activity associated with wealth the ability to purchase art and the leisure required to pursue or enjoy it the palaces of versailles or the hermitage in st petersburg with their vast collections of art amassed by the fabulously wealthy royalty of europe exemplify this view collecting such art is the preserve of the rich in one viewpoint before the one three th century in europe artisans were considered to belong to a lower caste since they were essentially manual labourers after europe was re exposed to classical culture during the renaissance particularly in the nation states of what is now italy florence siena artists gained an association with high status however arrangements of fine and expensive goods have always been used by institutions of power as marks of their own status this is seen in the two zero th and two one st century by the commissioning or purchasing of art by big businesses and corporations as decoration for their offices utility there are many who ascribe to certain arts the quality of being non utilitarian this fits within the art as good system of definitions and suffers from a class prejudice against labor and utility opponents of this view argue that all human activity has some utilitarian function and these objects claimed to be non utilitarian actually have the rather mundane and banal utility of attempting to mystify and codify unworkable justifications for arbitrary social hierarchy it might also be argued that non utilitarian is in this context a mis usage that art is not in and of itself useless but rather that it particularly use does not manifest itself in any traditionally demonstrable way though advances in neuroscience may arguably enable the isolation of those associated cortices of the brain concerned with the creation or appreciation of art art is also used by art therapists and some psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as art therapy the end product is not the principal goal in this case rather a process of healing through creative acts is sought the resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy the use of art from the artist s standpoint is as a means of expression when art is conceived as a device it serves several context and perspective specific functions from the artist s perspective it allows one to symbolize complex ideas and emotions in an arbitrary language subject only to the interpretation of the self and peers in a social context it can serve to soothe the soul and promote popular morale in a more negative aspect of this facet art is often utilised as a form of propaganda and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood in some cases artworks are appropriated to be used in this manner without the creator s initial intention from a more anthropological perspective art is a way of passing ideas and concepts on to later generations in a somewhat universal language the interpretation of this language is very dependent upon the observer s perspective and context and it might be argued that the very subjectivity of art demonstrates its importance in providing an arena in which rival ideas might be exchanged and discussed or to provide a social context in which disparate groups of people might congregate and mingle history of art the term art history typically refers to a historical examination of the various trends of the visual arts through certain periods of human history it may also be taken to encompass a study of the theories of art which may or may not include an examination of their historical context symbols much of the development of individual artist deals with finding principles for how to express certain ideas through various kinds of symbolism for example vasily kandinsky developed his use of color in painting through a system of stimulus response where over time he gained an understanding of the emotions that can be evoked by color and combinations of color contemporary artist andy goldsworthy on the other hand chose to use the medium of found natural objects and materials to arrange temporary sculptures cultural differences of art several genres of art are grouped by cultural relevance examples can be found in terms such as african art american craft islamic art asian art as found in buddhist art chinese art

actors in period costume sharing a joke whilst waiting between takes during location filming an actor is a person who acts or plays a role in an artistic production the term commonly refers to someone working in movies television live theatre or radio and can occasionally denote a street entertainer besides playing dramatic roles actors may also sing or dance or work only on radio or as a voice artist a female actor may be known as an actress although the term actor is also used as a gender neutral term an actor usually plays a fictional character in the case of a true story or a fictional story that portrays real people an actor may play a real person or a fictional version of the same occasionally actors appear as themselves etymology actor is directly from the masculine latin noun actor feminine actrix from the verb agere to do to drive to pass time the suffix or so st who performs the action indicated by the stem alternatively from greek aktor leader from the verb ag to lead or carry to convey to bring history the first recorded case of an actor performing took place in five three four bc probably on two three november though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly when the greek performer thespis stepped on to the stage at the theatre dionysus and became the first person to speak words as a character in a play the machinations of storytelling were immediately revolutionized prior to thespis act stories were told in song and dance and in third person narrative but no one had assumed the role of a character in a story in honour of thespis actors are commonly called thespians theatrical myth to this day maintains that thespis exists as a mischievous spirit and disasters in the theatre are sometimes blamed on his ghostly intervention actors were traditionally not people of high status and in the early middle ages travelling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust however this negative perception dramaticaly changed in two zero th century as acting became an honored and popular profession and art part of the reason is due to the rise of the popular appeal and access to dramatic film entertainment and the resulting rise of the movie star in social status and the large salaries they commanded the combination of public presence and wealth had a profound rehabilitation to the image in the past only men could become actors in the ancient and medieval world it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on the stage and this belief continued right up until the one seven th century when in venice it was broken in the time of william shakespeare women s roles were played by men or boys though there is some evidence to suggest that women disguised as men also illegally performed actors playing the opposite sex women sometimes play the roles of prepubescent boys because in some regards a woman has a closer resemblance to a boy than does a man the role of peter pan for example is traditionally played by a woman the tradition of the principal boy in pantomime may be compared an adult playing a child occurs more in theater than in film the exception to this is voice actors in animated films where boys are generally voiced by women as heard in the simpsons opera has several pants roles traditionally sung by women usually mezzo sopranos examples are hansel in h nsel und gretel and cherubino in the marriage of figaro mary pickford played the part of little lord fauntleroy in the first film version of the book linda hunt won an academy award for best supporting actress in the year of living dangerously in which she played the part of a man having an actor play the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long standing tradition in comic theatre and film most of shakespeare s comedies include instances of cross dressing and both dustin hoffman and robin williams appeared in hit comedy films where they were required to play most scenes dressed as women tony curtis and jack lemmon famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the billy wilder film some like it hot techniques of acting actors employ a variety of techniques that are learned through training and experience some of these are the rigorous use of the voice to communicate a character s lines and express emotion this is achieved through attention to diction and projection through correct breathing and articulation it is also achieved through the tone and emphasis that an actor puts on words physicalisation of a role in order to create a believable character for the audience and to use the acting space appropriately and correctly use of gesture to complement the voice interact with other actors and to bring emphasis to the words in a play as well as having symbolic meaning shakespeare is believed to have been commenting on the acting style and techniques of his era when hamlet gives his famous advice to the players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumbshows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance o erstep not the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some

trilobites first appeared toward the end of the lower cambrian and thrived in the middle cambrian the last agnostids held out until the late ordovician the agnostida are divided into two suborders agnostina and eodiscina that are then divided into a number of families the eodiscina appear to be normal trilobites with only two or three segments in the thorax some resemble trilobites of the order ptychopariida as a group agnostids have pygidia tails that are similar in size and shape to their cephalons heads neither looks much like the corresponding regions of other trilobites there has been more than one argument about which end is the head agnostids were probably benthic bottom dwelling creatures most agnostid species have no eyes they likely lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on detritus that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom unfortunately the appendages are known only for one genus of agnostid the legs of that genus look much more like crustacean legs than the legs of other trilobites with preserved appendages this has caused many taxonomists to question whether the agnostids are truly trilobites another view is that the agnostids represent the first line to have diverged from the trilobites however four orders of trilobites redlichiida corynexochida naraoidia ptychopariida considerably predate the earliest agnostids in the fossil record agnostina are generally referred to simply as agnostids even though they probably should be called agnostines external links agnostida fact sheet a guide to the eight orders of trilobites by sam gon iii prehistoric arthropods an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy associated with the death of an embryo or a fetus this can occur spontaneously in the form of a miscarriage or be intentionally induced through chemical surgical or other means generally abortions are performed by gynaecologists or obstetricians all mammalian pregnancies can be aborted however this article focuses exclusively on the abortion of human pregnancy there have been various methods of inducing an abortion throughout the centuries in the two zero th century the ethics and morality of abortion became the subject of intense political debate in many areas of the world definitions pregnancy is defined by the medical community as beginning at the implantation of the embryo others differ however placing this initiation at conception the following medical terms are used to define an abortion spontaneous abortion miscarriage an abortion due to accidental trauma or natural causes induced abortion an abortion deliberately caused induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic abortions and elective abortions therapeutic abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman to preserve the woman s physical or mental health to terminate a pregnancy that would result in the birth of a child with defects which would be incompatible with life or associated with significant morbidity to selectively reduce the number of fetuses in a multiple pregnancy to lessen health risks involved elective abortion an abortion performed for any other reason methods of birth control that prevent implantation such as emergency contraception are not considered to be abortion however emergency contraception is generally considered equivalent to abortion by those who reject the medical definition of pregnancy a pregnancy that ends earlier than three seven completed weeks of gestation and where an infant is born and survives is termed a premature birth a pregnancy that ends with an infant dead upon birth at any gestational stage due to causes including spontaneous abortion or complications during delivery is termed a stillbirth in common parlance the term abortion is synonymous with induced abortion of a human fetus incidence the incidence of and reasons for induced abortion vary in regions in which abortion is generally permitted it has been estimated that the total number of induced abortions performed globally is approximately four six million per year two six million of these are said to occur in places in which abortion is legal the other two zero million happen where it is illegal some countries such as belgium and the netherlands experience a low rate of induced abortion while others like russia and vietnam have a comparatively high rate a one nine nine eight study aggregated data from studies in two seven countries on the reasons women seek to terminate their pregnancies it concluded that common factors cited to have influenced the abortion decision were the desire to delay or end childbearing concern over the interruption of work or education issues of financial or relationship stability and perceived immaturity in finland and the united states concern for the health risks posed by pregnancy in individual cases was not a factor commonly given whereas in bangladesh india and kenya such a concern was found to be more prevalent a two zero zero four study in which american women at clinics answered a questionnaire yielded similar results some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures such as eugenics the stigmatization of disabled persons preference for children of a specific sex disapproval of single motherhood insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control such as china s one child policy a combination of these factors can sometimes result in forced abortion forced sterilization infanticide child abandonment or sex selective abortion and infanticide which is illegal in most countries but difficult to stop in many areas especially in developing nations or where abortion is illegal women sometimes resort to back alley or self induced procedures the world health organization suggests that there are one nine million terminations annually which fit its criteria for an unsafe abortion see social issues for more information on these subjects forms of abortion spontaneous abortion spontaneous abortions generally referred to as miscarriages occur when an embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes a miscarriage is spontaneous loss of the embryo or fetus before the two zero th week of development spontaneous abortions after the two zero th week are generally considered to be preterm deliveries most miscarriages occur very early in a pregnancy approximately one zero five zero of pregnancies end in miscarriage depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman the risk for spontaneous abortion is greater in those with a history of more than three previous known spontaneous abortions those who have had a previous induced abortion those with systemic diseases and in women over age three five other causes can be infection of either the woman or the fetus immune responses or serious systemic diseases of the woman a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered an induced abortion some governments have laws increasing the criminal liability of a person who causes a miscarriage during an assault or other violent crime induced abortion a pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in a number of ways the manner selected depends chiefly upon the gestational age of the fetus in addition to the legality regional availability and or doctor patient preference for specific procedures surgical abortion u s president george w bush signs the partial birth abortion ban act of two zero zero three in the first fifteen weeks suction aspiration or vacuum abortion is the most common method manual vacuum aspiration or mva abortion consists of removing the fetus or embryo by suction using a manual syringe while the electric vacuum aspiration or eva abortion method uses an electric pump these techniques are equivalent differing only in the mechanism use to apply suction from the fifteenth week up until around the twenty sixth week a surgical dilation and evacuation d e is used d e consists of opening the cervix of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction dilation and curettage d c is a standard gynaecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy investigation of abnormal bleeding and abortion curettage refers to the cleaning of the walls of the uterus with a curette the world health organization recommends this sort of procedure also called sharp curettage only when mva is unavailable sharp curettage only accounted for two four of abortion procedures in the us in two zero zero two the term d and c can more generally be used to refer to the first trimester abortion procedure irrespective of the method used to perform the procedure other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third trimester premature delivery can be induced with prostaglandin this can be coupled with injecting the amniotic fluid with caustic solutions containing saline or urea very late abortions can be brought about by intact dilation and extraction intact d x which requires the surgical decompression of the fetus s head before evacuation and is sometimes termed partial birth abortion a hysterotomy abortion similar to a caesarian section but resulting in a terminated fetus can also be used at late stages of pregnancy it can be performed vaginally with an incision just above the cervix in the late mid trimester chemical abortion the molecular structure of the abortifacient drug mifepristone effective in the first trimester of pregnancy chemical also referred to as a medical abortion or non surgical abortions comprise one zero of all abortions in the united states and europe the process begins with the administration of either methotrexate or mifepristone followed by misoprostol when appropriately used nine eight of women undergoing medical termination of pregnancy will experience completed abortion without surgical intervention the food and drug administration currently approves the use of mifepristone up to four nine days gestation seven weeks though evidence based regimens exist for its use up to six one days gestation with similar success rates misoprostol alone can also be used though it is not fda approved for this purpose misoprostol cytotec alone has the advantage of costing less than one dollar for an effective dose as opposed to several hundred dollars for an effective dose of mifepristone in cases of failure of medical abortion vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically other means of abortion historically a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in folk medicine tansy pennyroyal black cohosh and the now extinct silphium see history of abortion the use of herbs in such a manner can cause serious even lethal side effects such as multiple organ failure and is not recommended by physicians abortion is sometimes attempted through means of trauma to the abdomen the degree of force applied if severe can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing miscarriage both accidental and deliberate abortions of this kind can be subject to criminal liability in many countries in burma indonesia malaysia the philippines and thailand there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage reported methods of unsafe self induced abortion include the misuse of the ulcer drug misoprostol and the insertion of non surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus health effects early term surgical abortion is a simple procedure and when performed by competent doctors and in some states nurse practitioners nurse midwives and physician assistants in first world nations before the one six th week is safer than carrying the pregnancy to term as with most surgical procedures the most common surgical abortion methods carry the risk of potentially serious complications these risks include a perforated uterus perforated bowel or bladder septic shock sterility and death the risk of complications occurring can increase depending on how far the pregnancy has progressed but may be counterbalanced by complications that would occur from carrying the pregnancy to term it is difficult to accurately assess the risks of induced abortion due to a number of factors these factors include wide variation in the quality of abortion services in different societies and among different socio economic groups a lack of uniform definitions of terms and difficulties in patient follow up and after care the degree of risk is also dependent upon the skill and experience of the practitioner maternal age health and parity gestational age pre existing conditions methods and instruments used medications used the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner and the quality of recovery and follow up care a highly skilled practitioner operating under ideal conditions will tend to have a very low rate of complications an inexperienced practitioner in an ill equipped and ill staffed facility on the other hand will often have a higher incidence of complications in the united kingdom the number of deaths due to legal abortion between the years of one nine nine one and one nine nine three was five as compared to the nine deaths caused by ectopic pregnancy during the same time frame in the united states during the year one nine nine nine there were a total of four deaths due to legal abortion some practitioners advocate using minimal anesthesia so that the patient can alert them to possible complications others recommend general anesthesia in order to prevent patient movement which might cause a perforation general anesthesia carries its own risks including death which is why public health officials recommend against its routine use dilation of the cervix carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause cervical incompetence in future pregnancies most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators and using osmotic rather than mechanical dilators after the first trimester of pregnancy instruments are placed within the uterus to remove the fetus these can on rare occasions cause perforation or laceration of the uterus and damage to structures surrounding the uterus laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can again on rare occasions lead to even more serious complications incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause hemorrhage and infection use of ultrasound verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion with immediate follow up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure will virtually eliminate this risk the sooner a complication is noted and properly treated the lower the risk of permanent injury or death in rare cases the abortion will be unsuccessful and the pregnancy will continue an unsuccessful abortion can also result in the delivery of a live neonate or infant this termed a failed abortion is more likely to occur if the procedure is carried out later in the pregnancy some doctors faced with this situation have voiced concerns about the ethical and legal ramifications of then letting the neonate die as a result recent investigations have been launched in the united kingdom by the confidential enquiry into maternal and child health cemach and the royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be use of other methods e g overdose of various drugs insertion of various objects into uterus for abortion is potentially dangerous carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death compared to abortions done by physicians suggested effects there is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion evidence whether in support of or against such claims might in part be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it breast cancer the abortion breast cancer abc hypothesis posits a causal relationship between having an induced abortion and a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the future an increased level of estrogen in early pregnancy helps to initiate cellular differentiation growth in the breast in preparation for lactation if this process is terminated through abortion before full differentiation in the third trimester then more vulnerable undifferentiated cells will be left than there were prior to the pregnancy it is proposed that this might result in an elevated risk of breast cancer the majority of interview based studies have indicated a link and some have been demonstrated to be statistically significant but there remains debate as to their reliability because of possible response bias larger and more recent record based studies such as one in one nine nine seven which used data from two national registries in denmark found the correlation to be negligible to non existent after statistical adjustment the national cancer institute conducted an official workshop with dozens of experts on the issue between february two four february two six two zero zero three which concluded from its examination of various evidence that it is well established that induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk these findings and how the denmark study statistically adjusted their overall results have been disputed by dr joel brind an invitee to the workshop and the leading scientific advocate of the abortion breast cancer hypothesis nevertheless gaps and inconsistencies remain in the research and the subject continues to be one of political and scientific contention fetal pain the experience of the fetus during abortion is a matter of medical ethical and public policy concern evidence is conflicting with some authorities holding that the fetus is capable of feeling pain from the first trimester and others maintaining that the neuro anatomical requirements for such experience do not exist until the second or third trimester pain receptors begin to appear in the seventh week of pregnancy the thalamus the part of the brain which receives signals from the nervous system and then relays them to the cerebral cortex starts to form in the fifth week however other anatomical structures involved in the nociceptic process are not present until much later in gestation links between the thalamus and cerebral cortex aren t forged until around the two three rd week researchers have observed changes in the heart rates and hormonal levels of newborn infants after circumcision blood tests and surgery effects which were alleviated with the administration of anesthesia others suggest that the human experience of pain being more than just physiological cannot be measured in such reflexive responses mental health some women will experience negative feelings as a result of elective abortion however whether this phenomenon is significant enough to warrant a general diagnosis or even classification as an independent syndrome see post abortion syndrome is a subject that is debated among members of the medical community data on the incidence of clinical depression mental illness post traumatic stress disorder and suicide in association with abortion remain inconclusive a comparative analysis of the suicide rates among postpartum and post abortive women in finland found a statistical correlation between abortion and suicide other studies have suggested a link between the elective termination of an unwanted pregnancy and an improvement in reported mental well being elective abortion may reduce the occurrence of depression in cases of unwanted pregnancy as compared to cases in which the pregnancy has been carried to completion but it is also sometimes reported as an additional stressor ibid the majority of evidence would seem to indicate that adverse emotional reactions to the procedure are most strongly influenced by pre existing psychological conditions and other negative factors ibid spontaneous abortion or miscarriage is known to present an increased risk of depression in women history of abortion bottom most dr caton s tansy pills an example of a clandestine advertisement the practice of induced abortion according to some anthropologists can be traced to ancient times there is evidence to suggest that historically pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods including the administration of abortifacient herbs the use of sharpened implements the application of abdominal pressure and other techniques soranus a two nd century greek physician suggested in his work gynecology that women wishing to abort their pregnancies should engage in violent exercise energetic jumping carrying heavy objects and riding animals he also prescribed a number of recipes for herbal bathes pessaries and bloodletting but advised against the use of sharp instruments to induce miscarriage due to the risk of organ perforation it is also known that the ancient greeks relied upon the herb silphium as both a contraceptive and an abortifacient the plant as the chief export of cyrene was driven to extinction but it is suggested that it might have possessed the same abortive properties as some of its closest extant relatives in the apiaceae family such folk remedies however varied in effectiveness and were not without risk tansy and pennyroyal for example are two poisonous herbs with serious side effects that have at times been used to terminate pregnancy one nine th century medicine saw advances in the fields of surgery anaesthesia and sanitation in the same era that doctors with the american medical association lobbied for bans on abortion in the united states and the british parliament passed the offences against the person act demand for the procedure continued however as the disguised but nonetheless open advertisement of abortion services in victorian times would seem to suggest social issues a number of of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion these like the suggested effects upon health listed above are a focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides the controversy effect upon crime rate a controversial theory attempts to draw a correlation between the unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall crime rate witnessed in the united states during the one nine nine zero s and the decriminalization of abortion two zero years prior the suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a one nine nine nine academic paper the impact of legalized abortion on crime authored by the economists steven d levitt and john donohue they attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes unwanted children especially those born to mothers who are african american impoverished adolescent uneducated and single the change coincided with what would ve been the adolescence or peak years of potential criminality of those who had not been born as a result of roe v wade and similar cases donohue and levitt s study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier and that those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions fellow economists christopher foote and christopher goetz criticized the methodology in the donahue levitt study noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as cocaine use and recalculating based on incidence of crime per capita they found no statistically significant results levitt and donohue responded to this by presenting an adjusted data set which took into account these concerns but they claim maintained the statistical significance of their initial paper such research has been criticized by some as being utilitarian discriminatory as to race and socioeconomic class and as promoting eugenics as a solution to crime levitt states in his book freakonomics that they are neither promoting nor negating any course of action merely reporting data as economists sex selective abortion the advent of both ultrasound and amniocentesis has allowed parents to determine sex before birth this has lead to the occurrence of sex selective abortion or the targeted termination of a fetus based upon its gender it is suggested that sex selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some places the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and the use of abortion to limit female births has been reported in mainland china taiwan south korea and india in india the economic role of men the costs associated with dowries and a hindu tradition which dictates that funeral rites must be performed by a male relative have lead to a cultural preference for sons the widespread availability of diagnostic testing during the one nine seven zero s and eight zero s lead to advertisements for services which read invest five zero zero rupees for a sex test now save five zero zero zero zero rupees for a dowry later in one nine nine one the male to female sex ratio in

the ball used in american football has a pointed oval or vesica piscis shape and usually has a large set of stitches along one side american football known in the united states simply as football is a competitive team sport the object of the game is to advance the football towards the opposing team s end zone and score points the ball can be advanced by carrying the ball or by throwing or handing it from one teammate to the other points can be scored in a variety of ways including carrying the ball over the goal line throwing the ball to another player past the goal line or kicking it through the goal posts the winner is the team with the most points when the time expires outside of the united states and a few other countries such as american samoa the sport is usually referred to as american football or sometimes as gridiron to differentiate it from other football games especially association football soccer and rugby football american football evolved as a separate sport from rugby football in the late one nine th century arena football is a variant of american football in canada the unqualified term football typically refers to canadian football a game which is a close relative of american football but different in several respects popularity since the one nine six zero s football has surpassed baseball as the most popular spectator sport in the united states the three two team national football league nfl is the most popular and only major professional american football league its championship game the super bowl is watched by nearly half of us television households and is also televised in over one five zero other countries super bowl sunday has become an annual ritual in late january or early february football is also the most watched sport on television in the us the nfl also operates a developmental league nfl europe with six teams based in european cities a colorado state university player runs with the ball as an air force academy player lines up a tackle college football is also extremely popular throughout the u s especially in markets not served by an nfl team several college football stadiums seat more than one zero zero zero zero zero fans which regularly sell out even high school football games can attract five figure crowds especially in hotbeds like western pennsylvania nebraska florida georgia and most especially texas ohio and california the weekly autumn ritual of college and high school football which includes marching bands cheerleaders and parties including the ubiquitous tailgate party is an important part of the culture in much of smalltown america it is a long standing tradition in the united states though not universally observed that high school football games are played on friday college games on saturday and professional games on sunday with an additional professional game on monday nights see monday night football it is often said of an outstanding college football player that he is likely to be playing on sundays one day meaning that he is a good pro prospect certain fall and winter holidays most notably thanksgiving christmas and new years day have traditional football games associated with them football is also played recreationally by amateur club and youth teams e g the pop warner little league programs there are also many semi pro teams in leagues where the players are paid to play but at a small enough salary that they generally must also hold a full time job pro football is played only in the united states and in the above mentioned nfl europe league the sport is popular as an amateur activity in mexico and american samoa and to a lesser extent in japan europe and australia a very similar sport canadian football is widely played in canada organized football is played almost exclusively by men and boys although a few amateur and semi professional women s leagues have begun play in recent years the rules of american football the object of american football is to score more points than the opposing team within a set time limit field and players the numbers on the field indicate the number of yards to the nearest end zone the field is often called the gridiron because the markings on the field resemble a grill the game is played on a rectangular field one two zero yards one one zero metres long by five three one three yards four nine metres wide the longer boundary lines are sidelines while the shorter boundary lines are end lines near each end of the field is a goal line they are one zero zero yards apart a scoring area called an end zone extends one zero yards beyond each goal line to each end line yard lines cross the field every five yards and are numbered from each goal line to the five zero yard line or midfield similar to a typical rugby league field two rows of lines known as hash marks parallel the side lines near the middle of the field all plays start with the ball on or between the hash marks at the back of each end zone are two goal posts also called uprights that are one eight five feet apart the posts are connected by a crossbar one zero feet from the ground successful kicks must go above the crossbar and between the uprights at many fields the uprights and crossbar are attached by a curved bar to a post outside the field of play to reduce the chance of players running into the supports each team has one one players on the field at a time however teams may substitute for any or all of their players between plays as a result players have very specialized roles and almost all of the five three players on an nfl team will play in any given game thus teams are divided into three separate units the offense the defense and the special teams see below in the nfl players jersey numbers are distributed according to a strict system e g quarterbacks always wear between one one nine game duration a standard football game consists of four one five minute typically one two minutes in high school football periods called quarters with an intermission called halftime after the second quarter the clock stops after certain plays therefore a game can last considerably longer often more than three hours in real time if an nfl game is tied after four quarters the teams play up to another one five minutes in an nfl overtime game the first team that scores wins if neither team scores the game is a tie college overtime rules are more complicated and are described at overtime sport advancing the ball advancing the ball in american football resembles the six tackle rule and the play the ball in rugby league football the team that takes possession of the ball the offense has four attempts called downs to advance the ball one zero yards towards their opponent s the defense s end zone when the offense gains one zero yards it gets a first down or another set of four downs to gain one zero yards if the offense fails to gain a first down one zero yards after four downs it loses possession of the ball except at the beginning of halves and after scores see kickoffs and free kicks below the ball is always put into play by a snap all players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage the position on the field where the play begins one offensive player the center then passes or snaps the ball between his legs to a teammate usually the quarterback players can then advance the ball in two ways by running with the ball also known as rushing one ball carrier can hand the ball to another this is known as a handoff by throwing the ball to a teammate known as passing the forward pass is a key factor distinguishing american and canadian football from other football sports the offense can throw the ball forward only once on a play and only from behind the line of scrimmage the ball can be thrown sideways or backwards at any time this type of pass is known as a lateral and is much rarer in american football than in rugby league or rugby union where a backwards pass is mandatory a play or down ends and the ball becomes dead after any of the following the player with the ball is forced to the ground or has his forward progress halted by members of the other team as determined by an official a forward pass flies out of bounds or touches the ground before it is caught this is known as an incomplete pass the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage for the next down the ball or the player with the ball goes beyond the dimensions of the field out of bounds a team scores a certain penalty is committed such as false start that causes the play to be blown dead and replayed officials blow a whistle to notify all players that the play is over at all times players and fans must be aware of the sequence of downs and the distance to a new first down when a team has a first down the scoreboard or television screen flashes one st and one zero that is first down and one zero yards to go if the team gains three yards on the first play for example the next down will be two nd and seven changes of possession the offense maintains possession of the ball unless one of the following things happens the team fails to get a first down that is move the ball forward at least one zero yards in four downs the defensive team takes over the ball at the spot where the play ends a change of possession in this manner is commonly called a turnover on downs the offense scores a touchdown or field goal the team that scored then kicks off the ball to the other team see scoring and kickoffs below the offense punts the ball to the defense a punt is a kick in which a player drops the ball and kicks it before it hits the ground punts are nearly always made on fourth down when the offensive team does not want to risk giving up the ball to the other team at its current spot on the field through a failed attempt to make a first down and feels it is too far from the other team s goal posts to kick a field goal a defensive player catches a forward pass this is called an interception and the player who makes the interception can run with the ball until tackled forced out of bounds or scores after the intercepting player is tackled or forced out of bounds his team s offensive unit returns to the field and takes over at his last position an offensive player drops the ball a fumble and a defensive player picks it up as with interceptions a player recovering a fumble can run with the ball until tackled or forced out of bounds lost fumbles and interceptions are together known as turnovers the offensive team misses a field goal attempt the defensive team gets the ball at the spot where the previous play began or in the nfl at the spot of the kick if the unsuccessful kick was attempted from within two zero yards of the end zone the other team gets the ball at its own two zero yard line that is two zero yards from the end zone an offensive player is tackled forced out of bounds or commits certain penalties in his own end zone this rare occurrence is called a safety see scoring below scoring a team scores points by the following plays a touchdown td is worth six points a touchdown is scored when a player runs the ball into or catches a pass in his opponent s end zone after a touchdown the scoring team attempts a conversion the ball is placed at the other team s three yard line the two yard line in the nfl the team can attempt to kick it over the crossbar and through the goal posts in the manner of a field goal for one point an extra point or run or pass it into the end zone in the manner of a touchdown for two points a two point conversion in collegiate and professional leagues the extra point is usually preferred its success rate is nine four in the nfl and nine three eight in the ncaa compared to four three in the nfl and four three five in the ncaa for two point conversions if the defense forces a turnover on an attempted conversion and runs the ball back to their opponent s endzone they are awarded with two points does not apply in the nfl a field goal fg is worth three points and it is scored by kicking the ball over the crossbar and through the goal posts field goals may be placekicked kicked when the ball is held vertically against the ground by a teammate or drop kicked a field goal is usually attempted on fourth down instead of a punt when the ball is close to the goal line or when there is little or no time left to otherwise score a safety is worth two points a safety is scored by the defense when the offensive player in possession of the ball is forced back into his own end zone and is tackled there or fumbles the ball out of the end zone certain penalties by the offense occurring in the end zone also result in a safety kickoffs and free kicks each half begins with a kickoff teams also kick off after scoring touchdowns and field goals the ball is kicked from a kicking tee which is made from one s own three zero yard line in the nfl and from the three five yard line in college football the other team s kick returner tries to catch the ball and advance it as far as possible where he is stopped is the point where the offense will begin its drive or series of offensive plays if a kick returner does not want to run with the ball he has the option to signal for a fair catch by waving his hands in the air before the catch he will then be allowed to catch the ball and kneel it down on the field without being tackled if the kick returner catches the ball in his own end zone he can either run with the ball or elect for a touchback by kneeling in the end zone the receiving team can then start its offensive drive from its own two zero yard line a touchback can also occur when the kick goes out of the end zone punts and turnovers in the end zone can also end in touchbacks if a kickoff goes out of bounds over the sidelines without being interfered by the receiving team the ball will be placed three zero yards from the spot of the kickoff traditionally at the receiving team s four zero yard line in the nfl or the three five yard line in college football after safeties there is a free kick instead of a kickoff a free kick is made from a team s own two zero yard line and can be punted or placekicked penalties rule violations are punished with penalties most penalties result in moving the football either towards the endzone in the case of a defensive penalty or away from the endzone in the case of an offensive penalty some defensive penalties give the offense an automatic first down in addition if a penalty gives the offensive team enough yardage to gain a first down the first down is automatically given if a penalty occurs during a play an official throws a yellow flag near the spot of the foul when the play is over the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of taking either the penalty or the result of the play for example say a defensive player commits an offsides penalty on first down by passing the line of scrimmage before the snap and the offense gains eight yards on the play the team with the ball has the option of taking the penalty and repeat the first down with five yards to go or declining the penalty and scrimmaging with two nd and two some common penalties false start a player on the offense other than a back moving parallel to the line of scrimmage moves just prior to the snap five yards offsides a player is on the wrong side of the ball at the start of a play five yards similar fouls touching an opponent before the snap is encroachment lining up alongside the football instead of behind it is a neutral zone infraction holding a blocker unfairly impedes a would be tackler or pass receiver by grabbing the player s jersey hooking or tackling when commited by the offense or by either team on a change of possession the penalty is ten yards when committed by the defense the penalty is five yards and an automatic first down is awarded to the offense if the penalty occurred beyond the line of scrimmage the penalty would be enforced from the spot of the foul pass interference after a pass is launched into the air a defender pushes hooks grabs or knocks down a would be pass receiver or if the receiver does the same to the defender to prevent an interception first down at the spot of the foul if against the defense one five yards from the previous spot in college football or ten yards from the previous spot if against the offense similar penalties before a pass are called as holding or illegal contact facemask a player places his hand on an opponent s facemask during a play five yards or fifteen a personal foul if the player hooks his fingers into the facemask or pulls on it roughing the passer kicker a player places a hard hit on a passer long enough after a pass has been thrown to consider the contact avoidable or places a hard hit on a punter or place kicker fifteen yards and automatic first down running into the kicker a lighter contact on a kicker especially after the kick has been made five yards intentional grounding the passer throws a forward pass not near any eligible receiver without first leaving the area behind where the blocking linemen were standing before the snap the pocket or the passer throws a forward pass outside of the pocket which does not reach the original line of scrimmage and is not near any eligible receiver ten yards plus loss of down except if the penalty occurred in the end zone then it is ruled a safety and the defense is awarded two points in college football and high school football the defense is also credited with a quarterback sack note that spiking the ball to stop the clock is exempt from this ineligible receiver downfield on every play the offense must have seven players on the line of scrimmage the player furthest from the ball on each side are eligible receivers the interior five players are considered ineligible to receive passes this penalty is called if one of the five interior players is more than five yards past the line of scrimmage during a forward pass dead ball personal foul after the play is blown dead a player tackles or makes rough contact with a player on the other team fifteen yards automatic first down if on defense unnecessary roughness a catch all for rough play that doesn t merit its own foul an example is an avoidable late hit on a ball carrier who has run out of bounds fifteen yards unsportsmanlike conduct another catch all call commonly used for taunting excessive celebration after a touchdown and certain banned forms of pantomime like slashing the throat fifteen yards the players as noted above most football players have highly specialized roles at the college and nfl levels most play only offense or only defense offense the offensive line consists of five players whose job is to protect the passer and clear the way for runners by blocking members of the defense except for the center offensive linemen generally do not handle the ball the quarterback receives the ball on most plays he then hands or tosses it to a running back throws it to a receiver or runs with it himself running backs line up behind or beside the qb and specialize in rushing with the ball they also block catch passes and on rare occasions pass the ball to others wide receivers line up near the sidelines they specialize in catching passes tight ends line up outside the offensive line they can either play like wide receivers try to catch passes or like offensive linemen protect the qb or create spaces for runners not all of these types of players will be in on every offensive play teams can vary the number of wide receivers tight ends and running backs on the field at one time defense the defensive line consists of three to five players who line up across from the offensive line they try to tackle the running backs before they can gain yardage or the quarterback before he can throw a pass at least three players line up as defensive backs they cover the receivers and try to stop pass completions they occasionally rush the quarterback the other players on the defense are known as linebackers they line up between the defensive line and backs and may either rush the quarterback or cover potential receivers special teams the units of players who handle kicking plays are known as special teams special teams feature players that include the punter who handles punts and the placekicker or kicker who kicks off and attempts field goals and extra points basic football strategy to many fans the chief draw of football is the chess game that goes on between the two coaching staffs each team has a playbook of dozens to hundreds of plays plays are the directions for what the players should do on a down some plays are very safe they are very likely to get a few yards but not much more than that other plays have the potential for long gains but a greater risk of a loss of yardage or a turnover generally speaking rushing plays are less risky than passing plays however there are relatively safe passing plays and risky running plays to fool the other team there are passing plays designed to look like running plays and vice versa there are many trick or gadget plays such as when a team lines up like it is going to kick and then tries to run or pass for a first down such high risk plays are a great thrill to the fans when they work however they can spell disaster if the opposing team realizes the deception and acts accordingly it has been said that football is the closest sport that strategically resembles real war which may explain why it is by far the most popular sport in the american military in fact the united states military academy the united states naval academy and the united states air force academy each field football teams that participate in division i a of the ncaa army and navy have a particularly historic rivalry a physical game american football is a collision sport to stop the offense from advancing the ball the defense must tackle the player with the ball by knocking him down as such defensive players must use some form of physical contact to bring the ball carrier to the ground within certain rules and guidelines tacklers cannot kick punch or trip the runner they also cannot grab the face mask of the runner s helmet lead into a tackle with their own helmet or lift the ball carrier up off his feet and drop him despite these and other rules regarding unnecessary roughness most other forms of tackling are legal blockers and defenders trying to evade them also have wide leeway in trying to force their opponents out of the way quarterbacks are regularly hit by defenders coming on full speed from outside the quarterback s field of vision the high level of physical contact in football makes it more dangerous than other major american team sports to compensate for this players must wear a good deal of special protective equipment such as a padded plastic helmet shoulder pads hip pads and knee pads these protective paddings were introduced decades ago and improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players despite protective equipment and rule changes to emphasize safety injuries remain very common in football due to its physical nature twenty five football players mostly high schoolers died from injuries directly related to football from two zero zero zero two zero zero four according to the national center for catastrophic sport injury research concussions are common with an estimated six two zero zero zero suffered every year among high school players according to the brain injury association of arizona it is common to see injuries in the game and deaths are not unheard of the game is particularly risky when played by amateurs without proper gear such as is common amongst americans in backyards and parks across the country some have criticized american football as a violent sport american football is indeed quite physical in comparison to sports like basketball and soccer as well as other major american team sports tackle football is often banned in american schoolyards in favor of touch football which uses two hand touching instead of tackling or flag football in which a player is tackled when an opponent pulls a flag off a belt attached to the player s waist school physical education classes often use the two hand touch version of the game leaving the tackles to the school s official after school sports program which can provide the appropriate gear and supervision the level of physical aggression and risk of injury has also made football less appealing to females as they generally lack the muscle and body mass to compete without serious risk the tackle nature of football also tends to favor the largest and strongest players along with the fastest the average weight of players in the nfl has increased in recent years all these factors have brought the sport into controversy in the past few decades joining the group of other violent and thus controversial sports such as dodgeball wrestling hockey and boxing critics argue that these sports emphasize size physical strength and brute force and breed aggression and unhealthy competitive attitudes in children others argue that such sports teach sportsmanship and teamwork and though contact sports are all violent to some degree they always emphasize skill and strategy over mere belligerence development of the game both american football and soccer have their origins in varieties of football played in the united kingdom in the mid one nine th century and american football is directly descended from rugby football rugby was first introduced to north america in canada brought by the british army garrison in montreal which played a series of games with mcgill university both canadian and american football evolved from this point for an in depth overview of the differences and similarities of canadian football and american football see comparison of canadian and american football american colleges spearheaded the growth of football the first inter collegiate football game was played between rutgers and princeton universities on november six one eight six nine the game was won by rutgers six four although the game which bore little resemblance to its modern day counterpart was played with two teams of two five men each under rugby like rules but like modern football it was replete with surprise strategy prodigies of determination and physical prowess to use the words of one of the rutgers players rutgers football american football in its current form grew out of a series of three games between harvard university and mcgill university of montreal in one eight seven four mcgill played rugby football while harvard played the boston game which was closer to soccer as often happened in those days of far from universal rules the teams alternated rules so that both would have a fair chance the harvard players liked having the opportunity to run with the ball and in one eight seven five persuaded yale university to adopt rugby rules for their annual game in one eight seven six yale harvard princeton and columbia formed the intercollegiate football association which used the rugby code except for a slight difference in scoring in one eight eight zero walter camp introduced the scrimmage in place of the rugby scrum in one eight eight two the system of downs was introduced to thwart princeton s and yale s strategy of controlling the ball without trying to score in one eight eight three the number of players was reduced at camp s urging to eleven and camp introduced the soon standard arrangement of a seven man offensive line with a quarterback two halfbacks and a fullback on september three one eight nine five the first professional football game was played in latrobe pennsylvania between the latrobe ymca and the jeannette athletic club latrobe won the contest one two zero by the one eight nine zero s interlocking offensive formations such as the flying wedge and the practice of teammates physically dragging ball carrying players forward had made the game extremely dangerous despite restrictions on the flying wedge and other precautions in one nine zero five eighteen players were killed in games president theodore roosevelt informed the universities that the game must be made safer to force them to respond to his concerns he threatened to pressure congress to make playing football a federal crime in one nine zero six two rival organizing bodies the intercollegiate rules committee and the intercollegiate athletic association met in new york eventually they agreed on several new rules intended to make the game safer among them the addition of a neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and a requirement that at least six players from each team line up on them the most far reaching innovation they considered though was the legalization of the forward pass this was very controversial at the time much derided by purists as an alternative means of opening out the play walter camp would have preferred widening the field but representatives from harvard pointed to recently constructed harvard stadium which could not be widened and the forward pass was adopted it has come to shape the whole history of american football as opposed to its cousins around the world in one nine one zero after further deaths interlocking formations were finally outlawed and in one nine one two the field was changed to its current size the value of a touchdown increased to six points and a fourth down added to each possession the game had achieved its modern form problems in football injuries are more common in american football than in many other sports although rule changes made in the past nine zero years for instance the elimination of horse collar tackles have gradually lowered the rates of injuries in addition protective equipment has become better for example the optional leather helmets introduced during the one eight nine zero s have been replaced in several stages by required high tech padded plastic helmets with bars protecting the face more recently the use of steroids and the extent thereof has become an object of debate in professional college and even high school football leagues another problem with football is that it is an expensive sport the specialized helmets uniforms and pads can cost hundreds of dollars there is a widespread perception that football teams based in schools and public recreational leagues consume far more than their fair share of the sports budget although sales of tickets to college and to some extent high school football games often make it a revenue producing sport cleveland browns stadium in cleveland ohio home of the

the american revolution it was fought primarily between great britain and revolutionaries within thirteen british colonies in north america who proclaimed themselves as the united states of america early in the war the war began largely as a colonial revolt against the economic policies of the british empire and eventually widened far beyond british north america with france spain and the netherlands entering the war against great britain additionally many native americans fought on both sides of the conflict throughout the war the british were able to use their naval superiority to capture and occupy coastal cities but control of the countryside where most of the population lived largely eluded them french involvement proved decisive with a naval victory in the chesapeake leading to the surrender of a british army at the battle of yorktown in one seven eight one the treaty of paris in one seven eight three recognized the independence of the united states of america the terms american revolutionary war and american revolution are often used interchangeably though the american revolution included political and social developments before and after the war itself this article refers solely to the military campaign for a broader perspective including the origins and aftermath of the war see the article on the american revolution combatants choosing sides colonists were divided over which side to support in the war in some areas the struggle was a civil war the revolutionaries also known as americans or patriots had the support of about four zero to four five percent of the colonial population about one five to two zero percent of the population supported the british crown during the war and were known as loyalists or tories loyalists fielded perhaps five zero zero zero zero men during the war years in support of the british empire after the war some seven zero zero zero zero loyalists departed most going to canada great britain or to british colonies in the caribbean when the war began the americans did not have a professional army also known as a standing army each colony had traditionally provided for its own defenses through the use of local militia militiamen served for only a few weeks or months at a time were generally reluctant to go very far from home and would often come and go as they saw fit militia typically lacked the training and discipline of regular troops but could be effective when an emergency energized them seeking to coordinate military efforts the continental congress established on paper a regular army the continental army in june one seven seven five and appointed george washington as commander in chief the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington reluctantly augmented the regular troops with militia throughout the war although as many as two five zero zero zero zero men may have served as regulars or as militiamen for the revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war there were never more than nine zero zero zero zero total men under arms for the americans in any given year armies in north america were small by european standards of the era the greatest number of men that washington personally commanded in the field at any one time was fewer than one seven zero zero zero european nations german troops serving with the british in north america c ziegler after conrad gessner one seven nine nine early in one seven seven five the british army consisted of about three six zero zero zero men worldwide but wartime recruitment steadily increased this number additionally over the course of the war the british hired about three zero zero zero zero german mercenaries popularly known in the colonies as hessians because many of them came from hesse kassel germans would make up about one third of the british troop strength in north america by one seven seven nine the number of british and german troops stationed in north america was over six zero zero zero zero though these were spread from canada to florida france the netherlands and spain entered the war against great britain in an attempt to dilute britain s emerging superpower status early on all three countries quietly provided financial assistance to the american rebels france officially entered the war in one seven seven eight and soon sent troops ships and military equipment to fight against the british for the remainder of the war spain entered the war in one seven seven nine officially as an ally of france but not the united states spain was not keen on encouraging similar rebellions in her own empire the netherlands entered the war late in one seven eight zero but was soon overwhelmed by the british blacks and native americans african americans slaves and free blacks served on both sides during the war black soldiers served in northern militias from the outset but this was forbidden in the south where slaveowners feared arming slaves lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued an emancipation proclamation in november one seven seven five promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the british sir henry clinton issued a similar edict in new york in one seven seven nine tens of thousands of slaves escaped to the british lines although possibly as few as one zero zero zero served under arms many of the rest served as orderlies mechanics laborers servants scouts and guides although more than half died in smallpox epidemics that swept the british forces and a number were driven out of the british lines when food ran low despite dunmore s promises the majority were not given their freedom in response and because of manpower shortages washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the continental army in january one seven seven six all black units were formed in rhode island and massachusetts many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters another all black unit came from haiti with french forces at least five zero zero zero black soldiers fought for the patriot cause most american indian communities east of the mississippi river were affected by the war many divided over the question of which side to support most native americans who joined the fight fought against the united states since native lands were threatened by expanding american settlement an estimated one three zero zero zero warriors fought on the british side the largest group the iroquois confederacy fielded about one five zero zero warriors against the americans war in the north massachusetts one seven seven four to one seven seven six map of campaigns in the revolutionary war in one seven seven four the british parliament effectively abolished the provincial government of massachusetts lieutenant general thomas gage already the commander in chief of british troops in north america was also appointed governor of massachusetts and was instructed by king george s government to enforce royal authority in the troublesome colony however popular resistance compelled the newly appointed royal officials in massachusetts to resign or to seek refuge in boston gage commanded four regiments of british regulars about four zero zero zero men from his headquarters in boston but the countryside was in the hands of the revolutionaries on the night of april one eight one seven seven five general gage sent nine zero zero men to seize munitions stored by the colonial militia at concord massachusetts several riders including paul revere alerted the countryside and when the british troops entered lexington on the morning of april one nine they found seven five minutemen formed up on the village common shots were exchanged and the british moved on to concord where there was more fighting by the time the redcoats as the british soldiers were called began the return march several thousand militiamen had gathered along the road a running fight ensued and the british detachment suffered heavily with the battle of lexington and concord the shot heard round the world the war had begun afterwards thousands of militiamen converged on boston bottling up the british in the city late in may gage received by sea about four five zero zero reinforcements and a trio of generals who would play a vital role in the war william howe john burgoyne and henry clinton they formulated a plan to break out of the city on june one seven one seven seven five british forces under general howe seized the charleston peninsula at the battle of bunker hill the battle was technically a british victory but losses were so heavy that the attack was not followed up thus the siege was not broken and general gage was soon replaced by general howe as the british commander in chief in july one seven seven five newly appointed general washington arrived outside boston to take charge of the colonial forces the standoff continued throughout the fall and winter in early march one seven seven six heavy cannons that had been captured by the revolutionaries at fort ticonderoga were moved to boston a difficult feat engineered by henry knox when the guns were placed on dorchester heights overlooking the british positions howe s situation became untenable the british evacuated the city on march one seven one seven seven six and sailed for temporary refuge in halifax nova scotia the local militia dispersed and in april washington took most of the continental army to fortify new york city canada one seven seven five to one seven seven six during the long standoff at boston the continental congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere congress had initially invited french canadians to join them as the fourteenth colony but when that failed to happen an invasion of canada was authorized in an attempt to drive the british from the primarily francophone colony of quebec comprising present day quebec and ontario two expeditions were undertaken on september one six one seven seven five brigadier general richard montgomery marched north from fort ticonderoga with about one seven zero zero militiamen capturing montreal on november one three general guy carleton the governor of canada escaped to quebec city the second expedition led by colonel benedict arnold set out from fort western present day maine on september two five the expedition was a logistical nightmare and many men succumbed to smallpox by the time arnold reached quebec city in early november he had but six zero zero of his original one one zero zero men nevertheless arnold demanded the surrender of the city to no avail montgomery joined arnold and they attacked quebec city on december three one but were soundly defeated by carleton montgomery was killed arnold was wounded and many men were taken prisoner the americans held on outside quebec city until the spring of one seven seven six and then withdrew another attempt was made by the revolutionaries to push back towards quebec but failed at trois rivi res on june eight one seven seven six carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated arnold in the battle of valcour island in october arnold fell back to fort ticonderoga where the invasion of canada had begun the invasion of canada ended as an embarrassing disaster for the revolutionaries but arnold s improvised navy on lake champlain delayed the fateful british counter thrust the saratoga campaign until one seven seven seven new york and new jersey one seven seven six to one seven seven seven having withdrawn from boston the british now focused on capturing new york city general howe with the services of his brother admiral lord howe began amassing troops on staten island in july one seven seven six general washington with a smaller army of about two zero zero zero zero men unwittingly violated a cardinal rule of warfare and divided his troops about equally between long island and manhattan thus allowing the howes to engage only one half of the continental army at a time in late august the howes transported about two two zero zero zero men including nine zero zero zero hessians to long island in the battle of long island on august two seven one seven seven six the british expertly executed a surprise flanking maneuver driving the revolutionaries back to the brooklyn heights fortifications general howe then laid siege to the works but washington skillfully managed a nighttime evacuation to manhattan having taken long island the howes moved to seize manhattan on september one five general howe landed about one two zero zero zero men on lower manhattan quickly taking control of new york city the revolutionaries withdrew to harlem heights where they skirmished the next day but held their ground when howe moved to encircle washington s army in october the revolutionaries again fell back and a battle at white plains was fought on october two eight one seven seven six once more washington retreated but howe instead of aggressively pursuing the withdrawal returned to manhattan and captured fort washington in mid november taking almost three zero zero zero prisoners four days later fort lee across the hudson river from fort washington was also taken emanuel leutze s one eight five one painting washington crossing the delaware is an iconic image of american history general lord cornwallis continued to chase washington s army through new jersey until the revolutionaries withdrew across the delaware river into pennsylvania in early december with the campaign at an apparent conclusion for the season the british entered winter quarters although howe had missed several opportunities to crush the diminishing rebel army he had killed or captured over five zero zero zero americans he controlled much of new york and new jersey and was in a good position to resume operations in the spring with the rebel capital of philadelphia in striking distance the outlook of the continental army and thus the revolution itself was bleak these are the times that try men s souls wrote thomas paine who was with the army on the retreat the army had dwindled to fewer than five zero zero zero men fit for duty and would be reduced to one four zero zero after enlistments expired at the end of the year spirits were low popular support was wavering and congress had abandoned philadelphia in despair washington reacted by taking the offensive stealthily crossing the delaware on christmas night and capturing nearly one zero zero zero hessians at the battle of trenton on december two six one seven seven six cornwallis marched to retake trenton but was outmaneuvered by washington who successfully attacked the british rearguard at princeton on january three one seven seven seven washington then entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey having retaken much of new jersey and having secured two bold morale boosting victories in quick succession to reinvigorate the flagging revolution saratoga campaign one seven seven seven in the summer of one seven seven seven the british launched a new expedition from canada led by general burgoyne the intention was to seize the lake champlain and hudson river corridor effectively isolating new england from the rest of the american colonies burgoyne s invasion had two components he would lead about one zero zero zero zero men along lake champlain towards albany new york while a second column of about two zero zero zero men led by barry st leger would move down the mohawk river valley and link up with burgoyne in albany burgoyne set off in early july recapturing fort ticonderoga from the retreating revolutionaries without firing a shot he then proceeded overland towards albany but revolutionaries slowed his progress through the wilderness by destroying bridges and felling trees in his path running short on supplies in august burgoyne sent a detachment to raid nearby bennington vermont the raiders were decisively defeated by local militia depriving burgoyne of nearly one zero zero zero men and the much needed supplies the mohawk leader joseph brant commanded both american indians and white loyalists during the american revolutionary war meanwhile st leger half of his force american indians led by joseph brant had laid siege to fort stanwix on the mohawk river about eight zero zero revolutionary militiamen and their indian allies marched to relieve the siege but were ambushed and scattered by british and indians on august six at the battle of oriskany iroquois warriors fought on both sides of the battle marking the beginning of a civil war within the six nations when a second relief expedition approached this time led by benedict arnold the siege was lifted and st leger s expedition returned to canada burgoyne was on his own burgoyne pushed on towards albany his forces now reduced to about six zero zero zero men a revolutionary army of about eight zero zero zero men commanded by the newly arrived general horatio gates had entrenched about one zero miles one six km south of saratoga new york burgoyne sent two zero zero zero men to outflank the revolutionary position but was checked by generals benedict arnold and daniel morgan in the first battle of saratoga on september one nine one seven seven seven after the battle the two armies dug in burgoyne was in trouble now but he hoped that help from the south might be on the way all along burgoyne had suggested that his invasion from canada might be supported by a british offensive up the hudson river from howe s location in new york city however british war planners did not coordinate their efforts general howe had instead sailed away from new york on an expedition to capture philadelphia see next section british general henry clinton left in command at new york did indeed sail up the hudson in october capturing several forts and burning kingston then the rebel capital of new york but his efforts were not enough to affect the events at saratoga revolutionary militiamen many of them outraged by the reported murder of an american woman at the hands of burgoyne s indian allies flocked to gates s army swelling his force to one one zero zero zero by the beginning of october burgoyne his position becoming desperate launched a new offensive the second battle of saratoga on october seven the attack was repelled and general arnold though relieved of command by gates rushed to the battle and led a decisive counterattack badly beaten burgoyne surrendered on october one seven saratoga is often regarded as the turning point of the war revolutionary confidence and determination suffering from howe s successful occupation of philadelphia was renewed even more importantly the victory encouraged france to enter the war against great britain spain and the netherlands soon did the same for the british the war had now become much more complicated philadelphia campaign one seven seven seven to one seven seven eight having secured new york city in his one seven seven six campaign in one seven seven seven general howe concentrated on capturing philadelphia the seat of the revolutionary government he moved slowly landing one five zero zero zero troops in late august at the northern end of chesapeake bay about five five miles nine zero km southwest of philadelphia washington positioned his one one zero zero zero men between howe and philadelphia but was outflanked and driven back at the battle of brandywine on september one one one seven seven seven the continental congress once again abandoned the city british and revolutionary forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days clashing in minor encounters such as the so called paoli massacre on september two six howe finally outmaneuvered washington and marched into philadelphia unopposed after taking the city the british garrisoned about nine zero zero zero troops in germantown five miles eight km above philadelphia washington unsuccessfully attacked germantown in early october and then retreated to watch and wait meanwhile the british secured the delaware river by taking with difficulty forts mifflin and mercer in november general washington s problems at this time were not just with the british in the so called conway cabal some politicians and officers unhappy with washington s recent performance as commander in chief secretively discussed his removal washington offended by the behind the scenes maneuvering laid the whole matter openly before congress his supporters rallied behind him and the episode abated washington and his army encamped at valley forge in december one seven seven seven about two zero miles three two km from philadelphia where they would stay for the next six months over the winter two five zero zero men out of one zero zero zero zero died from disease and exposure however the army eventually emerged from valley forge in good order thanks in part to a training program supervised by baron von steuben meanwhile there was a shakeup in the british command with general clinton replacing howe as commander in chief french entry into the war had changed british war strategy and clinton was ordered by the government to abandon philadelphia and defend new york city now vulnerable to french naval power washington s army shadowed clinton on his withdrawal and forced a battle at monmouth on june two eight one seven seven eight the last major battle in the north washington s second in command general charles lee ordered a controversial retreat during the battle allowing clinton s army to escape by july clinton was in new york city and washington was again at white plains both armies were back where they had been two years earlier with the exception of scattered minor actions in the north like the battle of stony point the focus of the war now shifted elsewhere war in the west main article frontier warfare during the american revolution george rogers clark s one eight zero mile two nine zero km trek in the dead of winter led to the capture of general henry hamilton lieutenant governor of canada west of the appalachian mountains the american revolutionary war was an indian war the british and the continental congress both courted american indians as allies or urged them to remain neutral and many native american communities became divided over what path to take like the iroquois confederacy tribes such as the cherokees and the shawnees split into factions delawares under white eyes signed the first american indian treaty with the united states but other delawares joined the british the british supplied their indian allies from forts along the great lakes and tribesmen staged raids on revolutionary settlements in new york kentucky pennsylvania and elsewhere joint iroquois loyalist attacks in the wyoming valley and at cherry valley in one seven seven eight helped provoke the scorched earth sullivan expedition into western new york during the summer of one seven seven nine on the western front every man woman and child regardless of race was a potential casualty in the ohio country the virginia frontiersman george rogers clark attempted to neutralize british influence among the ohio tribes by capturing the outposts of kaskaskia and vincennes in the summer of one seven seven eight when general henry hamilton the british commander at detroit retook vincennes clark returned in a surprise march in february one seven seven nine and captured hamilton himself however a decisive victory in the west eluded the united states even as their fortunes had risen in the east the low point on the frontier came in one seven eight two with the gnadenhutten massacre when pennsylvania militiamen unable to track down enemy warriors executed nearly one zero zero christian delaware noncombatants mostly women and children later that year in the last major encounter of the war a party of kentuckians was soundly defeated by a superior force of british regulars and native americans war in the south during the first three years of the american revolutionary war the primary military encounters were in the north one notable exception was in june one seven seven six when general henry clinton sailed south to attack charleston south carolina this ended in humiliating defeat for the british and the patriots remained in control of the southern states for the next three years starting in one seven seven eight the british once again turned their attention to georgia south carolina north carolina and virginia where they hoped to regain control by recruiting thousands of loyalists on december two nine one seven seven eight an expeditionary corps of three five zero zero men from clinton s army in new york captured savannah georgia an attempt by french and revolutionary forces to retake savannah failed on october nine one seven seven nine in this assault count casimir pulaski the polish commander of american revolutionary cavalry was mortally wounded with savannah secured clinton could now launch a new assault on charleston south carolina where he had failed in one seven seven six carolinas one seven eight zero to one seven eight one the

american civil war with relatively few casualties clinton had seized the south s biggest city and seaport winning perhaps the greatest british victory of the war and paving the way for what seemed like certain conquest of the south the remnants of the southern continental army began to withdraw to north carolina but were pursued by colonel tarleton who defeated them at the battle of waxhaws on may two nine one seven eight zero among the americans a story spread that tarleton had massacred many americans after they had surrendered the truth of this charge is still debated bloody tarleton became a hated name and tarleton s quarter referring to his reputed lack of mercy or quarter soon became a rallying cry with these events organized american military activity in the south had collapsed the states however carried on their functions and the war was carried on by partisans such as francis marion general clinton turned over british operations in the south to lord cornwallis the continental congress dispatched general horatio gates to the rescue with a new army but gates promptly suffered one of the worst defeats in u s military history at the battle of camden on august one six one seven eight zero setting the stage for cornwallis to invade north carolina the tables were quickly turned on cornwallis however one wing of his army was utterly defeated at the battle of kings mountain on october seven one seven eight zero delaying his move into north carolina kings mountain was noteworthy because it was not a battle between british redcoats and colonial troops it was a battle between american loyalists and american patriots the british plan to raise large loyalist armies failed not enough loyalists enlisted and those who did were at risk once the british army moved on only in georgia did the crown manage to create a counter revolutionary civil government gates was replaced by george washington s most dependable subordinate general nathanael greene greene assigned about one zero zero zero men to general daniel morgan a superb tactician who crushed tarleton s troops at the battle of cowpens on january one seven one seven eight one greene proceeded to wear down his opponents in a series of battles guilford court house hobkirk s hill ninety six and eutaw springs each of them tactically a victory for the british but giving no strategic advantage to the victors greene summed up his approach in a motto that would become famous we fight get beat rise and fight again unable to capture or destroy greene s army cornwallis moved north to to virginia virginia one seven seven five to one seven eight one virginia had been under revolutionary control since loyalist forces including runaway slaves under governor dunmore had been defeated at the battle of great bridge on december nine one seven seven five after the defeat dunmore and his troops took refuge on british ships off of norfolk which dunmore bombarded and burned on january one one seven seven six he was driven from an island in chesapeake bay that summer never to return british forces raided virginia sporadically during the war in january one seven eight one the rebel capital of richmond was put to the torch by none other than benedict arnold now a turncoat who had sold his services to the other side and was now a british general in march one seven eight one general washington dispatched lafayette to defend virginia the young frenchman had three two zero zero men at his command but british troops in the state now reinforced and commanded by cornwallis totaled seven two zero zero lafayette skirmished with cornwallis avoiding a decisive battle while gathering reinforcements the boy cannot escape me cornwallis is supposed to have said however cornwallis was unable to trap lafayette and so he moved his forces to yorktown virginia in july in order to link up with the british navy war at sea main article naval operations in the american revolutionary war meanwhile the co operation of the french became active in july count rochambeau arrived at newport rhode island that place had been occupied by the british from one seven seven six to the close of one

fleet under admiral sir george rodney over a french fleet under the comte de grasse the defeat dashed the hopes of france and spain to take jamaica and other colonies from the british india the franco british war spilled over into india in one seven eight zero in the form of the second anglo mysore war the two chief combatants were tipu sultan ruler of the kingdom of mysore and a key french ally and the british government of madras the anglo mysore conflict was bloody but inconclusive and ended in a draw at the treaty of mangalore in one seven eight four netherlands also in one seven eight zero the british struck against the united provinces of the netherlands in the fourth anglo dutch war to preempt dutch involvement in the league of armed neutrality directed primarily against the british navy during the war agitation by dutch radicals and a friendly attitude towards the united states by the dutch government both influenced by the american revolution also encouraged the british to attack the war lasted into one seven eight four and was disastrous to the dutch mercantile economy mediterranean on february five one seven eight two spanish and french forces captured minorca which had been under british control since the treaty of utrecht in one seven one three a further franco spanish effort to recover gibraltar was unsuccessful minorca was ceded to spain in the peace treaty whitehaven an interesting footnote to this war was the actual landing on britain itself of a ship from the u s navy this occurred in one seven seven eight when the port of whitehaven in cumberland was raided by john paul jones the landing was a surprise attack taken as an action of revenge by jones and was never intended as an invasion nevertheless it caused hysteria in england with the attack showing a weakness that could be exploited by other states such as france or spain its result was an intense period of fortification in british ports war s end the northern southern and naval theaters of the war converged at yorktown in one seven eight one on september five one seven eight one french naval forces defeated the british royal navy at the battle of the chesapeake cutting off cornwallis s supplies and transport washington hurriedly moved his troops from new york and a combined franco american force of one seven zero zero zero troops commenced the battle of yorktown on

the surrender british prime minister lord north resigned soon after hearing the news from yorktown in april one seven eight two the british house of commons voted to end the war in america on november three zero one seven eight two preliminary peace articles were signed in paris the formal end of the war did not occur until the treaty of paris was signed on september three one seven eight three and the united states congress ratified the treaty on january one four one seven eight four the last british troops left new york city on november two five one seven eight three the reasons for great britain s misfortunes and defeat may be summarized as follows misconception by the home government of the temper and reserve strength of her colonists disbelief at the outset in the probability of a protracted struggle covering the immense territory in america consequent failure of the british to use their more efficient military strength effectively the safe and fabian generalship of washington and perhaps most significantly the french alliance and european combinations by which at the close of the conflict left great britain without a friend or ally on the continent decisive victory eluded the united states on the western frontier great britain negotiated the paris peace treaty without consulting her indian allies however and ceded much american indian territory to the united states full of resentment native americans reluctantly confirmed these land cessions with the united states in a series of treaties but the result was essentially an armed truce the fighting would be renewed in conflicts along the frontier the largest being the northwest indian war casualties the total loss of life resulting from the american revolutionary war is unknown as was typical in the wars of the era disease claimed more lives than battle the war took place in the context of a massive smallpox epidemic in north america that probably killed more than one three zero zero zero zero people historian joseph j ellis suggests that washington s decision to have his troops inoculated may have been the commander in chief s most important strategic decision casualty figures for the american revolutionaries have varied over the years a recent scholarly estimate lists six eight two four killed and eight four four five wounded in action the number of revolutionary troop deaths from disease and other non combat causes is estimated at about one eight five zero zero approximately one two zero zero germans were killed in action and six three five four died from illness or accident about one six zero zero zero of the remaining german troops returned home but roughly five five zero zero remained in the united states after the war for various reasons many becoming american citizens no

one coulomb per second it is named after andr marie amp re one of the main discoverers of electromagnetism definition the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to two newton per metre of length explanation because it is a base unit the definition of the ampere is not tied to any other electrical unit the definition for the ampere is equivalent to fixing a value of the permeability of vacuum to zero four h m prior to one nine four eight the so called international ampere was used defined in terms of the electrolytic deposition rate of silver the older unit is equal to zero nine nine nine eight five a the ampere is most accurately realised using an ampere balance but is in practice maintained via ohm s law from the units of voltage and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson junction and the quantum hall effect respectively the unit of electric charge the coulomb is defined in terms of the ampere one coulomb is the amount of electric charge formerly quantity of electricity carried in a current of one ampere flowing for one second current electricity then is the rate at which charge flows through a wire or surface one ampere of current i is equal to a flow of one coulomb of charge q per second of time t mathrm since a coulomb is approximately equal to six two four elementary charges one ampere is equivalent to six two four elementary charges such as electrons moving through a surface in one second more precisely using the si definitions for the conventional values of the josephson and von klitzing constants the ampere can be defined as exactly six two four one five zero nine six two nine one five two six five elementary charges per second see also si ohm

a position behind the offensive line or behind the linebackers on defense blitz a defensive maneuver in which one or more linebackers or defensive backs who normally remain behind the line of scrimmage instead charge into the opponents backfield however in the three four defense one linebacker typically rushes the passer with the three down linemen this is not considered a blitz if an additional linebacker is sent bringing the total number of rushers to five it is a blitz blocking when a player obstructs another player s path with his body bootleg an offensive play predicated upon misdirection in which the quarterback pretends to hand the ball to another player and then carries the ball in the opposite direction of the supposed ballcarrier with the intent of either passing or running sometimes the quarterback has the option of doing either a naked bootleg is a risky variation of this play when the quarterback has no blockers pulling out with him contrast with scramble sneak and draw the box an area on the defensive side of the ball directly opposite the offensive linemen and about five yards deep having eight players in the box means bringing in a defensive back

he is close enough will often attempt to kick the ball out of bounds close to the receiving team s goal line and pin them back near their own end zone contain a defensive assignment on outside runs such as the sweep one defensive player usually a cornerback or outside linebacker is assigned to keep the rusher from getting to the edge of the play and turning upfield if executed properly the rusher will have to turn upfield before the play calls for it giving the linebackers a better chance of stopping the play for little or no gain cornerback cb a defensive back who lines up near the line of scrimmage across from a wide receiver their primary job is to disrupt passing routes and to defend against short and medium passes in the passing game and to contain the rusher on rushing plays counter a running play in which the running back will take a step in the apparent direction of the play ie the direction the line is moving only to get the handoff in the other direction weak side linemen will sometimes pull and lead the back downfield sometimes called a counter trap but not necessarily the play is designed to get the defense to flow away from the action for a few steps as they follow the linemen allowing more room for the running back crackback block an illegal block delivered below the opponent s waist by an offensive player who had left the area of close line play and then returned to it or was not within it at the snap the term is also used to describe a legal block delivered from the front or from the side with the offensive player s helmet in front of the

technique in which offensive linemen and sometimes other blockers block legally below the waist i e from the front of the defensive player in an attempt to bring the defenders to ground making them

because a dime has the same value as two nickels double reverse a play in which the ball reverses direction twice behind the line of scrimmage this is usually accomplished by means of two or three hand offs each hand off going in an opposite direction as the previous one such a play is extremely infrequent in football some people confuse the double reverse with a reverse which is a play with two hand offs instead of three down one of a series of plays in which the offensive team must advance at least one zero yards or lose possession first down is the first of the plays fourth is the last down in american and third in canadian football a first down occurs after a change of possession of the ball after advancing the ball one zero yards following a previous first down or after certain

of scrimmage just before the snap in american football only one offensive player can be in motion at a time cannot be moving toward the line of scrimmage at the snap and may not be a player who is on the line of scrimmage in canadian football more than one back can be in motion and may move in any direction as long as they are behind the line of scrimmage at the snap man to man coverage a defense in which all players in pass coverage typically linebackers and defensive backs cover a specific player pure man coverage is very rare defenses typically mix man and zone coverage mike the m iddle linebacker mo the other middle linebacker in a three four formation muff a loose ball that is dropped or mishandled while the player is attempting to gain possession n national football league the largest professional american football league neutral zone the region between the lines of scrimmage or between the free kick restraining lines nfl the national football league nickel back an extra or fifth defensive back named after the coin worth five cents popularized by the miami dolphins in the one nine seven zero s now common no huddle offense a tactic wherein the offense quickly forms near the line of scrimmage without huddling before the next play nose tackle a tackle in a three man defensive line who lines up opposite the center s nose o offensive team the team with possession of the ball offside an infraction of the rule that requires both teams to be on their own side of their restraining line as or before the ball is put play offside is normally called on the defensive team in canadian football at the time a ball is kicked by a teammate being ahead of the ball or being the person who held the ball for the place kick one back formation a formation where the offensive team has one running back in the backfield with the quarterback other eligible receivers are near the line of scrimmage onside kick a play in which the kicking team tries to recover the kicked ball option usually a type of play in which the quarterback has the option of handing off keeping or laterally passing to one or more backs often described by a type of formation or play action such as triple option veer option or counter option teams running option plays often specialize in them less often a play in which a back may either pass or run outside opposite of inside p package the group of players on the field for a given play for example the nickel package substitutes a cornerback for either a linebacker or a defensive lineman the latter is referred to as a three three five nickel or the jumbo package substitutes a wide receiver with a tight end pass interference when a player illegally hinders an eligible receiver s opportunity to catch forward pass passing play a play in which a forward pass is made place kick kicking the ball from where it has been placed stationary on the ground or where legal on a tee play the action between the snap of the ball and the end of play signaled by the official s whistle for a tackle or out of bounds the plan of action the offensive team has for each snap for example a running play or pass play play action a tactic in which the quarterback fakes either a handoff or a throw in order to draw the defense away from the intended offensive method play clock a timer used to increase the pace of the game between plays the offensive team must snap the ball before the time expires currently the nfl uses four zero seconds two five seconds after a time out playing field see field of play pocket an area on the offensive side of the line of scrimmage where the offensive linemen attempt to prevent the defensive players from reaching the quarterback during passing plays position a place where a player plays relative to teammates and or a role filled by that player prevent defense a defensive strategy that utilizes deep zone coverage in order to prevent a big pass play from happening downfield usually at the expense of giving up yards at shorter distances often used against hail mary plays or at the end of the game when the defending team is protecting a lead disparaged by many fans john madden legendary player coach and commentator has been quoted as saying the only thing a prevent defense prevents is a win pulling a term used to describe an offensive lineman who instead of blocking the player in front of him steps back and moves down the line pulls to block another player usually in a trap or sweep punt a kick in which the ball is dropped and kicked before it reaches the ground used to give up the ball to the opposition after offensive downs have been used as far down the field as possible punter a kicker who specializes in punting as opposed to place kicking q quarterback qb an offensive player who lines up behind the center from whom he takes the snap quick kick an unexpected punt r receiver a wide receiver reception when a player catches receives the ball red dog a blitz red zone the area between the two zero yard line and the goal of the defensive team referee r the official who directs the other officials on the field he is one of seven officials restraining line a team s respective line of scrimmage at a free kick the line the ball is to be kicked from for the kicking team or a line one zero yards in advance of that for the receiving team reverse an offensive play in which a ballcarrier going toward one side of the field hands or tosses the ball to a teammate who is running in the opposite direction if the second ballcarrier is an end it is an end around run and shoot an offensive philosophy designed to force the defense to show its hand prior to the snap of the ball by splitting up receivers and sending them in motion receivers run patterns based on the play of the defenders rather than a predetermined plan running back a player position on offense although the term usually refers to the halfback or tailback fullbacks are also considered runningbacks running play a play where the offense attempts to advance the ball without passing rush trying to tackle or hurry a player before he can throw a pass or make a kick a running play s sack tackling a ball carrier who intends to throw a forward pass a sack is also awarded if a player forces a fumble of the ball or the ball carrier to go out of bounds behind the line of scrimmage on an apparent intended forward pass play the term gained currency ca one nine seven zero safety a player position on defense see free safety and strong safety a method of scoring worth two points by downing an opposing ballcarrier in his own end zone forcing the opposing ballcarrier out of his own end zone and out of bounds or forcing the offensive team to fumble the ball so that it exits the end zone a safety is also awarded if the offensive team commits a penalty within its own end zone after a safety the team that was scored upon must kick the ball to the scoring team from its own two zero yard line a safety scored during a try scores one point and is followed by a kickoff as for any other try safety valve a receiver whose job it is to get open for a short pass in case all other receivers are covered sam the s trong side outside linebacker scramble on a called passing play when the quarterback runs from the pocket in an attempt to avoid being sacked giving the receivers more time to get open or attempting to gain positive yards by running himself screen pass a short forward pass to a receiver who has blockers in front of him the receiver in this play is usually a running back although wide receiver and tight end screens are also used although the are both called screen passes the wide receiver screen and the running back screen are used for very different reasons in the case of a running back screen the play is designed to allow the pass rushers by the offensive linemen leaving the defender out of position to make a play the play is usually employed to defuse the pass rush in the case of a running back screen the wide receiver screen is a much faster developing play designed to catch the defense off guard scrimmage see play from scrimmage shift when two or more offensive players move at the same time before the snap all players who move in a shift must come to a complete stop prior to the snap shooting the action of a linebacker or defensive back to blitz shotgun formation formation in which offensive team may line up at the start of a play in this formation the quarterback receives the snap five eight yards behind the center sideline one of the lines marking each side of the field

overload and wingback on one side and two backs about five yards deep to receive the snap slobber knocker a particularly gruesome tackle or hit slot the area between a split end and the offensive line a pass receiver lined up in the slot at the snap of the ball may be called a slotback or slot receiver snap the handoff or pass from the center that begins a play from scrimmage sneak an offensive play in which the quarterback immediately on receiving the snap dives forward with the ball the play is used when a team needs a very short gain to reach either the goal line or the line to gain special teams the units that handle kickoffs punts free kicks and field goal attempts spike a play in which the quarterback throws the ball at the ground immediately after the snap technically an incomplete pass it stops the clock note that a spike is not considered intentional grounding splits the distance between the feet of adjacent offensive linemen said to be wide if there is a large gap between players or narrow if the gap is small split end a player position on offence a receiver who lines up on the line of scrimmage several yards outside the offensive linemen the term is no longer used in american football having been long since replaced by the wide receiver or wideout with no distinction between whether the receiver is on the line or not squib kick a type of kickoff in which the ball is intentionally kicked low to the ground typically bouncing on the ground a few times before being picked up this is done in the hopes of preventing a long return as the ball is often picked up by one of the upmen as opposed to the designated kickoff returner sticks the pole attached to the end of the one zero yard chain that is used by the chain crew to measure for a new series of downs i e the line to gain a new first down stiff arm or straight arm a ballcarrier warding off a would be tackler by pushing them away with a straight arm strong i a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback and the fullback is lined up offset to the strong side of the formation strong safety ss a kind of safety on defense as opposed to a free safety this is a central defensive back originally the term indicated that he lined up on the strong side of the field and covered the tight end however the modern usage of the term now indicates a central defensive back with responsibility for run and pass support slightly favoring run support strong side simplistically speaking the side of the field left or right that has the most players but it depends on the formations of the teams when a team uses one tight end the strong side is the side of the field where the tight end lines up if the offensive package uses no tight end or more than one tight end the strong side is the side of the field with the most offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage stunt a tactic used by defensive linemen in which they switch roles in an attempt to get past the blockers both defenders will start with power rushes with the stunting defender getting more of a push the other lineman will then go around him ideally using him as a pick to get free from his blocker sweep a running play in which several blockers lead a running back on a designed play to the outside depending on the number of blockers and the design of the play this is sometimes referred to as a power sweep or student body right or left t t formation a classic offensive formation with the quarterback directly behind the center and three running backs behind the quarterback forming a t numerous variations have been developed including the split t wing t and wishbone t tackle the act of forcing a ball carrier to the ground a player position on the line either an offensive tackle or a defensive tackle see linemen tackle box the area between where the two offensive tackles line up prior to the snap tailback player position on offense farthest deepest back except in kicking formations also often referred to as the running back particularly in a one back offense three and out when an offensive team fails to gain a first down on the first three plays of a drive and thus is forced to punt on fourth down three point stance a down lineman s stance with three points on the ground in another words his two feet and one of his hands tight end a player position on offense an eligible receiver ligned up on the line of scrimmage next to the offensive tackle tight ends are used as blockers during running plays and either run a route or stay in to block during passing plays touchback the act of downing the ball behind one s own goal line after the ball had been propelled over the goal by the opposing team after a touchback the team that downed it gets the ball at their own two zero yard line touchdown a play worth six points accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent s end zone it also allows the team a chance for one extra point by kicking the ball or a two point conversion see try below trap a basic blocking pattern in which a defensive lineman is allowed past the line of scrimmage only to be blocked at an angle by a pulling lineman designed to gain a preferred blocking angle and larger hole in the line trips a formation in which three wide receivers are lined up close to one another on the same side of the field also refers to those receivers used to create potential for confusion or collision between defenders as these receivers split up two point conversion a play worth two points accomplished by gaining legal possession of the ball in the opponent s end zone after a touchdown has been made see try below try a scrimmage play from close to their opponent s goal line awarded to a team which has scored a touchdown allowing them and in some codes their opponents to score an additional one or two points also called try for point conversion convert canadian extra point s point s after touchdown or pat u unbalanced line usually refers to an offensive formation which does not have an equal number of linemen on each side of the ball done to gain a blocking advantage on one side of the formation typically one tackle or guard lines up on the other side of the ball for example a common alignment would be e g c g t t e upman during a kickoff every player on the return team is called an upman with the exception of the one or two designated kickoff returners who stand furthest away from the starting point of the kicking team v veer a type of option offense using two backs in the backfield one behind each guard or tackle referred to as split backs allowing a triple option play give to either back or quarterback keep w weak i a formation wherein the tailback is lined up deep directly behind the quarterback and the fullback is lined up offset to the weak side of the formation weak side when one tight end is used the side of the field opposite the tight end in other offensive packages the side of the field with the fewest offensive players on or just behind the line of scrimmage west coast offense an offensive philosophy that uses short high percentage passes as the core of a ball control offense widely used but originally made popular by san francisco four nine ers coach bill walsh a main component of the west coast offense is use of all the eligible receivers in the short passing game wide receiver a player position on offense he is split wide usually about one zero yards from the formation and plays on the line of scrimmage as a split end or one yard off as a flanker will the w eak side linebacker wing back a player position in some offensive formations lines up just outside the tight end and one yard off the line of scrimmage may be a receiver but is more typically used as a blocking back wishbone a formation involving three running backs lined up behind the quarterback in the shape of a y similar to the shape of a wishbone x x receiver term used in play calling that usually refers to the split end or the wide receiver that lines up on the line of scrimmage for example split right jet five two nine x post tells the x receiver to run a post route y y receiver term usually used in offensive play calling to refer to the tight end for example buffalo right five three four boot y corner tells the y receiver to run a corner route z z receiver a term used in offensive play calling that usually refers to the flanker or the wide receiver that lines up off the line of scrimmage for example panther gun eight five slant z go tells the z receiver to run a go also called a fly or streak route zone defense a defense in which players who are in pass coverage cover zones of the field instead of individual players pure zone packages are seldom used most defenses employ some combination of zone and man coverage zone blitz a defensive package combining a blitz with zone pass coveragee allows the defense to choose the blitzer after the offense shows formation and pass coverage requirements and features unpredictable blitzes from different linebackers and defensive backs invented by coach dick lebeau american football terminology glossaries flowcharts are often used to represent algorithms in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is a procedure a finite set of well defined instructions for accomplishing some task which given an initial state will terminate in a defined end state informally the concept of an algorithm is often illustrated by the example of a recipe although many algorithms are much more complex algorithms often have steps that repeat iterate or require decisions such as logic or comparison the concept of an algorithm originated as a means of recording procedures for solving mathematical problems such as finding the common divisor of two numbers or multiplying two numbers the concept was formalized in one nine three six through alan turing s turing machines and alonzo church s lambda calculus which in turn formed the foundation of computer science most algorithms can be implemented by computer programs history the word algorithm comes from the name of the nine th century mathematician abu abdullah muhammad bin musa al khwarizmi the word algorism originally referred only to the rules of performing arithmetic using hindu arabic numerals but evolved via european latin translation of al khwarizmi s name into algorithm by the one eight th century the word evolved to include all definite procedures for solving problems or performing tasks the first case of an algorithm written for a computer was ada byron s notes on the analytical engine written in one eight four two for which she is considered by many to be the world s first programmer however since charles babbage never completed his analytical engine the algorithm was never implemented on it the lack of mathematical rigor in the well defined procedure definition of algorithms posed some difficulties for mathematicians and logicians of the one nine th and early two zero th centuries this problem was largely solved with the description of the turing machine an abstract model of a computer formulated by alan turing and the demonstration that every method yet found for describing well defined procedures advanced by other mathematicians could be emulated on a turing machine a statement known as the church turing thesis nowadays a formal criterion for an algorithm is that it is a procedure that can be implemented on a completely specified turing machine or one of the equivalent formalisms formalization of algorithms algorithms are essential to the way computers process information because a computer program is essentially an algorithm that tells the computer what specific steps to perform in what specific order in order to carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations which can be performed by a turing complete system typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data is read from an input source or device written to an output sink or device and or stored for further use stored data is regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm the state is stored in a data structure for any such computational process the algorithm must be rigorously defined specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise that is any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case by case the criteria for each case must be clear and computable because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps the order of computation will almost always be critical to the functioning of the algorithm instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are described as starting from the top and going down to the bottom an idea that is described more formally by flow of control so far this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming this is the most common conception and it attempts to describe a task in discrete mechanical means unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation setting the value of a variable it derives from the intuition of memory as a scratchpad there is an example below of such an assignment see functional programming and logic programming for alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm some writers restrict the definition of algorithm to procedures that eventually finish others include procedures that could run forever without stopping arguing that some entity may be required to carry out such permanent tasks in the latter case success can no longer be defined in terms of halting with a meaningful output instead terms of success that allow for unbounded output sequences must be defined for example an algorithm that verifies if there are more zeros than ones in an infinite random binary sequence must run forever to be effective if it is implemented correctly however the algorithm s output will be useful for as long as it examines the sequence the algorithm will give a positive response while the number of examined zeros outnumber the ones and a negative response otherwise success for this algorithm could then be defined as eventually outputting only positive responses if there are actually more zeros than ones in the sequence and in any other case outputting any mixture of positive and negative responses summarizing the above discussion about what algorithm should consist zero or more inputs one or more outputs finiteness or computability definitiveness or preciseness implementation an algorithm is a set of steps to perform a computation most algorithms will be implemented as computer programs they can be expressed in any notation including english for documenting and research purposes a more preferred way is to embody or sometimes called codify an algorithm by writing of its pseudocode pseudocode representation avoids ambiguities that are common in english statements the pseudocode can also be translated into particular programming language more straightforwardly algorithms are implemented not only as computer programs but often also by other means such as in a biological neural network for example the human brain implementing arithmetic or an insect relocating food in electric circuits or in a mechanical device example one of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in an unsorted list of numbers the solution necessarily requires looking at every number in the list but only once at each from this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in english as let us assume the first item is largest look at each of the remaining items in the list and make the following adjustment a if it is larger than the largest item we gathered so far make a note of it the latest noted item is the largest in the list when the process is complete and here is a more formal coding of the algorithm in pseudocode input a non empty list of numbers l output the largest number in the list l largest l zero for each item in the list l one do if the item largest then largest the item return largest for a more complex example see euclid s algorithm which is one of the oldest algorithms algorithm analysis as it happens most people who implement algorithms want to know how much of a particular resource such as time or storage is required for a given algorithm methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers for example the algorithm above has a time requirement of o n using the big o notation with n as the length of the list at all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the largest number found so far and its current position in the input list therefore it is said to have a space requirement of o one note that the size of the inputs is not counted as space used by the algorithm different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time space or effort than others for example given two different recipes for making potato salad one may have peel the potato before boil the potato while the other presents the steps in the reverse order yet they both call for these steps to be repeated for all potatoes and end when the potato salad is ready to be eaten the analysis and study of algorithms is one discipline of computer science and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or other implementation in this sense it resembles other mathematical disciplines in that the analysis focuses on the underlying principles of the algorithm and not on any particular implementation the pseudocode is simplest and abstract enough for such analysis classes there are various ways to classify algorithms each with its own merits classification by implementation one way to classify algorithms is by implementation means recursion or iteration a recursive algorithm is one that invokes makes reference to itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches which is a method common to functional programming iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops and sometimes additional data structures like stacks to solve the given problems some problems are naturally suited for one implementation to other for example towers of hanoi is well understood in recursive implementation every recursive version has an equivalent but possibly more or less complex iterative version and vice versa serial or parallel algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time those computers are sometimes called serial computers an algorithm designed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm as opposed to parallel algorithms which take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time parallel algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and pass them to many processors and put the results back together at one end the resource consumption in parallel algorithms is both processor cycles on each processors and also the communication overhead between the processors sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but their communication overhead is expensive recursive algorithms are generally parallelizable some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems those problems cannot be solved faster by employing more processors iterative numerical methods such as newton s method or the three body problem are algorithms which are inherently serial deterministic or random deterministic algorithms solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm random algorithms as their name suggests explore the search space randomly until an acceptable solution is found various heuristic algorithms see below generally fall into the random category exact or approximate while many algorithms reach an exact solution approximation algorithms seek an approximation which is close to the true solution approximation may use either a deterministic or a random strategy such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems classification by design paradigm another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm there is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other furthermore each of these categories will include many different types of algorithms some commonly found paradigms include divide and conquer a divide and conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem usually recursively until the instances are small enough to solve easily one such example of divide and conquer is merge sorting sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in conquer phase by merging them a simpler variant of divide and conquer is called decrease and conquer algorithm that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so conquer stage will be more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms an example of decrease and conquer algorithm is binary search algorithm dynamic programming when a problem shows optimal substructure meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems and overlapping subproblems meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances we can often solve the problem quickly using dynamic programming an approach that avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted graph can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices dynamic programming and memoization go together the main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer where as the overlap of subproblems occur in dynamic programming the difference between the dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls where subproblems are independent there is no chance of repetition and memoization does not help so dynamic programming is not a solution for all by using memoization or maintaining a table of subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity the greedy method a greedy algorithm is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm but the difference is that solutions to the subproblems do not have to be known at each stage instead a greedy choice can be made of what looks best for the moment difference between dynamic programming and greedy method is it extends the solution with the best possible decision not all feasible decisions at a algorithmic stage based on the current local optimum and the best decision not all possible decisions made in previous stage it is not exhaustive and does not give accurate answer to many problems but when it works it will be the fastest method the most popular greedy algorithm is finding the minimal spanning tree as given by kruskal linear programming when solving a problem using linear programming the program is put into a number of linear inequalities and then an attempt is made to maximize or minimize the inputs many problems such as the maximum flow for directed graphs can be stated in a linear programming way and then be solved by a generic algorithm such as the simplex algorithm a complex variant of linear programming is called integer programming where the solution space is restricted to all integers reduction it is another powerful technique in solving many problems by transforming one problem into another problem for example one selection algorithm for finding the median in an unsorted list is first translating this problem into sorting problem and finding the middle element in sorted list the goal of reduction algorithms is finding the simplest transformation such that complexity of reduction algorithm does not dominate the complexity of reduced algorithm this technique is also called transform and conquer search and enumeration many problems such as playing chess can be modeled as problems on graphs a graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems this category also includes the search algorithms and backtracking the probabilistic and heuristic paradigm algorithms belonging to this class fit the definition of an algorithm more loosely probabilistic algorithms are those that make some choices randomly or pseudo randomly for some problems it can in fact be proven that the fastest solutions must involve some randomness genetic algorithms attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological evolutionary processes with a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of solutions thus they emulate reproduction and survival of the fittest in genetic programming this approach is extended to algorithms by regarding the algorithm itself as a solution to a problem also there are heuristic algorithms whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution but an approximate solution where the time or resources to find a perfect solution are not practical an example of this would be local search taboo search or simulated annealing algorithms a class of heuristic probabilistic algorithms that vary the solution of a problem by a random amount the name simulated annealing alludes to the metallurgic term meaning the heating and cooling of metal to achieve freedom from defects the purpose of the random variance is to find close to globally optimal solutions rather than simply locally optimal ones the idea being that the random element will be decreased as the algorithm settles down to a solution classification by field of study every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms related problems in one field are often studied together some example classes are search algorithms sort algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms and parsing techniques see also list of algorithms for more details some of these fields overlap with each other and advancing in algorithms for one field causes advancement in many fields and sometimes completely unrelated fields for example dynamic programming is originally invented for optimisation in resource consumption in industries but it is used in solving broad range of problems in many fields classification by complexity some algorithms complete in linear time and some complete in exponential amount of time and some never complete one problem may have multiple algorithms and some problems may have no algorithms some problems have no known efficient algorithms there are also mappings from some problems to other problems so computer scientists found it is suitable to classify the problems rather than algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity see also complexity classes for more details legal issues some countries allow algorithms to be patented when embodied in software or in hardware patents have long been a controversial issue see for example the software patent debate some countries do not allow certain algorithms such as cryptographic algorithms to be exported from that country see also algorism

annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color as they tend to produce more flowers than perennials some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience particularly if they are not considered hardy for the local climate also many food plants are or are grown as annuals including most domesticated grains the life cycle of an annual can occur in a period as short as two or three months in some species though most last a bit longer vegetables grown in apartment container gardens can last up to two years if they are maintained indoors during the

alexander had to repeat twice because the southern greeks rebelled after philip s death alexander conquered the persian empire including anatolia syria phoenicia gaza egypt bactria and mesopotamia and extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as the punjab alexander integrated foreigners non macedonians non greeks into his army and administration leading some scholars to credit him with a policy of fusion he encouraged marriage between his army and foreigners and practiced it himself after twelve years of constant military campaigning alexander died possibly of malaria typhoid viral encephalitis or even a drug overdose his conquests ushered in centuries of greek settlement and rule over foreign areas a period known as the hellenistic age alexander himself lived on in the history and myth of both greek and non greek cultures already during his lifetime and especially after his death his exploits inspired a literary tradition in which he appears as a towering legendary hero in the tradition of achilles early life bust of alexander iii in the british museum alexander was the son of king philip ii of macedon and of epirote princess olympias according to plutarch alexander three one three olympias was impregnated not by philip who was afraid of her and her affinity for sleeping in the company of snakes but by zeus plutarch alexander two two three relates that both philip and olympias dreamt of their son s future birth olympias dreamed of a loud burst of thunder and of lightning striking her womb in philip s dream he sealed her womb with the seal of the lion alarmed by this he consulted the seer aristander of telmessus who determined that his wife was pregnant and that the child would have the character of a lion aristotle was alexander s tutor he gave alexander a thorough training in rhetoric and literature and stimulated his interest in science medicine and philosophy after his visit to the oracle of ammon at siwa according to all five of the extant historians arrian curtius diodorus justin and plutarch rumors spread that the oracle had revealed alexander s father to be zeus rather than philip according to plutarch alexander two one his father descended from heracles through caranus and his mother descended from aeacus through neoptolemus and achilles aristotle gave him a copy of the illiad and a knife that he always hid under his pillow at night the ascent of macedon when philip led an attack on byzantium in three four zero bc alexander aged one six was left in command of macedonia in three three nine bc philip took a second wife to the chagrin of alexander s mother olympias which led to a quarrel between alexander and his father and threw into question alexander s succession to the macedonian throne in three three eight bc philip created the league of corinth alexander also assisted his father at the decisive battle of chaeronea in this year the cavalry wing led by alexander annihilated the sacred band of thebes an elite corps previously regarded as invincible philip was content to deprive thebes of her dominion over boeotia and leave a macedonian garrison in the citadel in three three six bc philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to king alexander of epirus the assassin was supposedly a former lover of the king the disgruntled young nobleman pausanias who held a grudge against philip because the king had ignored a complaint he had expressed philip s murder was once thought to have been planned with the knowledge and involvement of alexander or olympias another possible instigator could have been darius iii the recently crowned king of persia plutarch mentions an irate letter from alexander to darius where alexander blames darius and bagoas his grand vizier for his father s murder stating that it was darius who had been bragging with the greek cities of how he managed to assassinate philip after philip s death the army proclaimed alexander then aged two zero as the new king of macedon greek cities like athens and thebes which had been forced to pledge allegiance to philip saw in the new king an opportunity to retake their full independence alexander moved swiftly and thebes which had been most active against him submitted when he appeared at its gates the assembled greeks at the isthmus of corinth with the sole exception of the spartans elected him to the command against persia which had previously been bestowed upon his father the next year three three five bc alexander felt free to engage the thracians and the illyrians in order to secure the danube as the northern boundary of the macedonian kingdom while he was triumphantly campaigning north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again alexander reacted immediately and while the other cities once again hesitated thebes decided this time to resist with the utmost vigor the resistance was useless in the end the city was conquered with great bloodshed the thebans encountered an ever harsher fate when their city was razed to the ground and its territory divided between the other boeotian cities moreover all of the city s citizens were sold into slavery sparing only the priests the leaders of the pro macedonian party and the descendants of pindar whose house was the only one left untouched the end of thebes cowed athens into submission and it readily accepted alexander s demand for the exile of all the leaders of the anti macedonian party demosthenes first of all period of conquests map of alexander s empire the fall of the persian empire alexander s army had crossed the hellespont with about four two zero zero zero soldiers primarily macedonians and greeks but also including some thracians paionians and illyrians after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis and proceeded down the ionian coast at halicarnassus alexander successfully waged the first of many sieges eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea alexander left caria in the hands of ada who was ruler of caria before being deposed by her brother pixodarus from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities and denying them to his enemy from pamphylia onward the coast held no major ports and so alexander moved inland at termessus alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian city at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the tangled gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia according to the most vivid story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and he hacked it apart with his sword another version claims that he did not use the sword but actually figured out how to undo the knot alexander battling darius at the battle of issus pompei mosaic alexander s army crossed the cilician gates met and defeated the main persian army under the command of darius iii at the battle of issus in three three three bc darius fled this battle in such a panic for his life that he left behind his wife his children his mother and much of his personal treasure sisygambis the queen mother never forgave darius for abandoning her she disowned him and adopted alexander as her son instead proceeding down the mediterranean coast he took tyre and gaza after famous sieges see siege of tyre alexander passed near but probably did not visit jerusalem in three three two bc three three one bc alexander was welcomed as a liberator in egypt and was pronounced the son of zeus by egyptian priests of the god ammon at the oracle of the god at the siwa oasis in the libyan desert he founded alexandria in egypt which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death leaving egypt alexander marched eastward into assyria now northern iraq and defeated darius and a third persian army at the battle of gaugamela darius was forced to flee the field after his charioteer was killed and alexander chased him as far as arbela while darius fled over the mountains to ecbatana modern hamadan alexander marched to babylon statuette of a greek soldier from a four th three rd century bc burial site north of the tian shan at the maximum extent of alexander s advance in the east r mqi xinjiang museum china drawing from babylon alexander went to susa one of the achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury sending the bulk of his army to persepolis the persian capital by the royal road alexander stormed and captured the persian gates in the modern zagros mountains then sprinted for persepolis before its treasury could be looted alexander allowed the league forces to loot persepolis a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes and spread to the rest of the city it was not known if it was a drunken accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the athenian acropolis during the second persian war the book of arda wiraz a zoroastrian work composed in the three rd or four th century ad also speaks of archives containing all the avesta and zand written upon prepared cow skins and with gold ink that were destroyed but it must be said that this statement is often treated by scholars with a certain measure of skepticism because it is generally thought that for many centuries the avesta was transmitted mainly orally by the magians he then set off in pursuit of darius who was kidnapped and then murdered by followers of bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman bessus then declared himself darius successor as artaxerxes v and retreated into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander with the death of darius alexander declared the war of vengeance over and released his greek and other allies from service in the league campaign although he allowed those that wished to re enlist as mercenaries in his imperial army his three year campaign against first bessus and then the satrap of sogdiana spitamenes took him through media parthia aria drangiana arachosia bactria and scythia in the process he captured and refounded herat and maracanda moreover he founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate the furthest in modern tajikistan in the end both were betrayed by their men bessus in three two nine bc and spitamenes the year after hostility toward alexander during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis a symbolic kissing of the hand that persians paid to their social superiors but a practice of which the greeks disapproved the greeks regarded the gesture as the preserve of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it this cost him much in the sympathies of many of his countrymen here too a plot against his life was revealed and his companion philotas was executed for treason for failing to bring the plot to his attention parmenion philotas father who was at the head of an army at ecbatana was assassinated by command of alexander who feared that parmenion might attempt to avenge his son several other trials for treason followed and many macedonians were executed later on in a drunken quarrel at maracanda he also killed the man who had saved his life at granicus clitus the black later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life this one by his own pages was revealed and his official historian callisthenes of olynthus who had fallen out of favor with the king by leading the opposition to his attempt to introduce proskynesis was implicated on what many historians regard as trumped up charges however the evidence is strong that callisthenes the teacher of the pages must have been the one who persuaded them to assassinate the king the invasion of india coin commemorating alexander s campaigns in india struck in babylon around three two three bc obv alexander standing being crowned by nike fully armed and holding zeus thunderbolt rev greek rider possibly alexander attacking an indian battle elephant possibly fleeing porus with the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana roshanak in bactrian to cement his relations with his new central asian satrapies in three two six bc alexander was finally free to turn his attention to india king ambhi ruler of taxila surrendered the city to alexander many people had fled to a high fortress called aornos alexander took aornos by storm alexander fought an epic battle against porus a ruler of a region in the punjab in the battle of hydaspes in three two six bc after attaining victory alexander made an alliance with porus and appointed him as satrap of his own kingdom alexander then named one of the two new cities that he founded bucephala in honor of his noble mount who had brought him to india alexander continued on to conquer all the headwaters of the indus river east of porus kingdom near the ganges river was the powerful empire of magadha ruled by the nanda dynasty fearing the prospects of facing another powerful indian army and exhausted by years of campaigning his army mutinied at the hyphasis modern beas refusing to march further east alexander after the meeting with his officer coenus was convinced that it was better to return alexander was forced to turn south conquering his way down the indus to the indian ocean he sent much of his army to carmania modern southern iran with his general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest of his forces back to persia by the southern route through the gedrosia present day makran in southern pakistan after india alexander and porus by charles le brun one six seven three discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed a number of them as examples on his way to susa as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send those over aged and disabled veterans back to macedonia under craterus but his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis refusing to be sent away and bitterly criticizing his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units alexander executed the ringleaders of the mutiny but forgave the rank and file in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects he held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at opis but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year his attempts to merge persian culture with his greek soldiers also included training a regiment of persian boys in the ways of macedonians it is not certain that alexander adopted the persian royal title of shahanshah great king or king of kings however most historians believe that he did alexander let it be known that he intended to launch a campaign against the tribes of arabia after they were subjugated it was assumed that alexander would turn westwards and attack carthage and italy after traveling to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure his closest friend and possible lover hephaestion died of an illness alexander was distraught and on his return to babylon he fell ill and died alexander s marriages and sexuality alexander s greatest emotional attachment is generally considered to have been to his companion cavalry commander chiliarchos and probable lover hephaestion they had most likely been best friends since childhood for hephaestion too received his education at the court of alexander s father hephaestion makes his appearance in history at the point when alexander reaches troy there the two friends made sacrifices at the shrines of the two heroes achilles and patroclus alexander honoring achilles and hephaestion honoring patroclus as aelian in his varia historia one two seven claims he thus intimated that he was the object of alexander s love as patroclus was of achilles following hephaestion s death alexander mourned him greatly and did not eat for days many have discussed alexander s ambiguous sexuality curtius reports that he scorned feminine sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he be unable to beget offspring to encourage a relationship with a woman king philip and olympias brought in a high priced thessalian courtesan named callixena later in life alexander married several princesses of former persian territories roxana of bactria statira daughter of darius iii and parysatis daughter of ochus he fathered two children heracles born by his concubine barsine the daughter of satrap artabazus of phrygia in three two seven bc and alexander iv of macedon born by roxana shortly after his death in three two three bc curtius maintains that alexander also took as a lover bagoas a eunuch exceptional in beauty and in the very flower of boyhood with whom darius was intimate and with whom alexander would later be intimate vi five two three bagoas is the only one who is actually named as the eromenos the beloved of alexander their relationship seems to have been well known among the troops as plutarch recounts an episode also mentioned by dicaearchus during some festivities on the way back from india in which his men clamor for him to openly kiss the young man bagoas sat down close by him which so pleased the macedonians that they made loud acclamations for him to kiss bagoas and never stopped clapping their hands and shouting till alexander put his arms round him and kissed him at this point in time the troops present were all survivors of the crossing of the desert bagoas must have endeared himself to them by his courage and fortitude during that harrowing episode whatever alexander s relationship with bagoas it was no impediment to relations with his queen six months after alexander s death roxana gave birth to his son and heir alexander iv besides bagoas curtius mentions yet another possible lover of alexander euxenippus whose youthful grace filled him with enthusiasm vii nine one nine allegations concerning alexander s sexuality remain highly controversial and excite passions in some quarters people of various national ethnic and cultural origins regard him as their hero some argue that historical accounts describing alexander s love for hephaestion and bagoas as sexual were written centuries after the fact and thus it can never be established what the historical relationship between alexander and his male companions were others argue that the same can be said about much of our information regarding alexander such debates however are generally considered anachronistic by scholars of the period who point out that the concept of homosexuality as understood today did not exist in greco roman antiquity sexual attraction between males was seen as a normal and universal part of human nature since it was believed that men were attracted to beauty an attribute of the young regardless of gender if alexander s love life was transgressive it was not for his love of beautiful youths but for his probable involvement with a man his own age in a time when the standard model of male love was pederastic see pederasty in ancient greece for more information the army of alexander the great before the battle of gaugamela the army of alexander was for the most part that of his father philip it was composed of light and heavy troops and some engineers medical and staff units about one third of the army was composed of his greek allies from the hellenic league infantry macedonian battle formation courtesy of the department of history united states military academy the main infantry corps was the phalanx composed of six regiments taxies numbering about two zero zero zero phalangites each each soldier had a long pike called a sarissa which was up to two one feet long and a short sword for protection the soldier wore a phrygian style helmet and a shield arrian mentions large shields the aspis but this is disputed as it is difficult to wield both a large pike and a large shield at the same time many modern historians claim the phalanx used a smaller shield called a pelta the shield used by peltasts it is unclear whether the phalanx used body armor but heavy body armor is mentioned in arrian one two eight seven and other ancient sources modern historians believe most of the phalangites did not wear heavy body armor at the time of alexander another important unit were the hypaspists shield bearers arranged into three battalions lochoi of one zero zero zero men each one of the battalions was named the agema and served as the king s bodyguards their armament is unknown and it is difficult to get a clear picture from ancient sources sometimes hypaspists are mentioned in the front line of the battle just between the phalanx and the heavy cavalry moreover they seem to have acted as an extension of the phalanx fighting as heavy infantry while keeping a link between the heavily clad phalangites and the companion cavalry they also accompanied alexander on flanking marches and were capable of fighting on rough terrain like light troops so it seems they could perform dual functions in addition to the units mentioned above the army included some six zero zero zero greek allied and mercenary hoplites also arranged in phalanxes they carried a shorter spear a dora which was six or seven feet long and a large aspis alexander also had light infantry units composed of peltasts psiloi and others peltasts are considered to be light infantry although they had a helmet and a small shield and were heavier than the psiloi the best peltasts were the agrianians from thrace cavalry the heavy cavalry included the companion cavalry raised from the macedonian nobility and the thessalian cavalry the companion cavalry hetairoi friends was divided into eight squadrons called ile two zero zero strong except the royal squadron of three zero zero they were equipped with a one two foot lance the xyston and heavy body armor the horses were partially clad in armor as well the riders did not carry shields as the xyston required both hands to wield the organization of the thessalian cavalry was similar to the companion cavalry but they had a shorter spear and fought in a looser formation of light cavalry the prodromoi forerunners secured the wings of the army during battle and went on reconnaissance missions several hundred allied horses rounded out the cavalry death contemporary bust of alexander the great on the afternoon of june one zero one one three two three bc alexander died of a mysterious illness in the palace of nebuchadrezzar ii of babylon he was just one month shy of attaining three three years of age various theories have been proposed for the cause of his death which include poisoning by the sons of antipater or others sickness that followed a drinking party or a relapse of the malaria he had contracted in three three six bc what is certain is that on may two nine alexander participated in a banquet organized by his friend medius of larissa after some heavy drinking immediately or after a bath he was forced to bed badly ill the troops started rumors more and more anxious and on june nine the generals decided to let the soldiers see their king alive one last time they were admitted to his presence one at a time while the king too ill to speak confined himself to move his hand the day after alexander was dead the poisoning theory derives from the story held in antiquity by justin and curtius the original story stated that cassander son of antipater viceroy of greece brought the poison to alexander in babylon in a mule s hoof and that alexander s royal cupbearer iollas brother of cassander administered it many had powerful motivations for seeing alexander gone and were none the worse for it after his death deadly agents that could have killed alexander in one or more doses include hellebore and strychnine in r lane fox s opinion the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days had passed between the start of his illness and his death and in the ancient world such long acting poisons were probably not available though this discounts the possibility of multiple doses however the warrior culture of macedon favored the sword over strychnine and many ancient historians like plutarch and arrian maintained that alexander was not poisoned but died of natural causes instead it is likely that alexander died of malaria or typhoid fever which were rampant in ancient babylon other illnesses could have also been the culprit including acute pancreatitis or the west nile virus recently theories have been advanced stating that alexander may have died from the treatment not the disease hellebore believed to have been widely used as a medicine at the time but deadly in large doses may have been overused by the impatient king to speed his recovery with deadly results disease related theories often cite the fact that alexander s health had fallen to dangerously low levels after years of heavy drinking and suffering several appalling wounds including one in india that nearly claimed his life and that it was only a matter of time before one sickness or another finally killed him no story is conclusive alexander s death has been reinterpreted many times over the centuries and each generation offers a new take on it what is certain is that alexander died of a high fever on june one zero or one one of three two three bc on his death bed his marshals asked him to whom he bequeathed his kingdom since alexander had only one heir it was a question of vital importance he answered famously the strongest before dying his final words were i foresee a great funeral contest over me alexander s funeral games where his marshals fought it out over control of his empire lasted for nearly forty years alexander s death has been surrounded by as much controversy as many of the events of his life before long accusations of foul play were being thrown about by his generals at one another making it incredibly hard for a modern historian to sort out the propaganda and the half truths from the actual events no contemporary source can be fully trusted because of the incredible level of self serving recording and as a result what truly happened to alexander the great may never be known alexander s body was placed in a gold anthropid sarcophagus which was in turn placed in a second gold casket and covered with a purple robe alexander s coffin was placed together with his armor in a gold carriage which had a vaulted roof supported by an ionic peristyle the decoration of the carriage was very rich and is described in great detail by diodoros according to legend alexander was preserved in a clay vessel full of honey which acts as a preservative and interred in a glass coffin according to aelian varia historia one two six four ptolemy stole the body and brought it to alexandria where it was on display until late antiquity it was here that ptolemy ix one of the last successors of ptolemy i replaced alexander s sarcophagus with a glass one and melted the original down in order to strike emergency gold issues of his coinage the citizens of alexandria were outraged at this and soon after ptolemy ix was killed its current whereabouts are unknown the so called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeological museum is now generally thought to be that of abdylonymus whom hephaestion appointed as the king of sidon by alexander s order the sarcophagus depicts alexander and his companions hunting and in battle with the persians legacy and division of the empire coin of alexander bearing an aramaic language inscription after alexander s death his empire was divided among his officers mostly with the pretense of first preserving a united kingdom later his officers were focused on the explicit formation of rival monarchies and territorial states ultimately the conflict was settled after the battle of ipsus in phrygia in three zero one bc alexander s empire was divided at first into four major portions cassander ruled in macedon lysimachus in thrace seleucus in mesopotamia and iran and ptolemy in the levant and egypt antigonus ruled for a while in asia minor and syria but was eventually defeated by the other generals at ipsus three zero one bc control over indian territory was short lived when seleucus was defeated by chandragupta maurya the first mauryan emperor by two seven zero bc hellenistic states consolidated with the antigonid empire centered on macedon the seleucid empire in asia the ptolemaic kingdom in egypt palestine and cyrenaica by the one st century bc though most of the hellenistic territories in the west had been absorbed by the roman republic in the east they had been dramatically reduced by the expansion of the parthian empire and the secession of the greco bactrian kingdom alexander s conquests also had long term cultural effects with the flourishing of hellenistic civilization throughout the middle east and central asia and the development of greco buddhist art in the indian subcontinent influence on ancient rome a mural in pompeii depicting the marriage of alexander to barsine stateira in three two four bc the couple are apparently dressed as ares and aphrodite alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements although very little is known about roman macedonian diplomatic relations of that time julius caesar wept in spain at the mere sight of alexander s statue and pompey the great rummaged through the closets of conquered nations for alexander s two six zero year old cloak which the roman general then wore as the costume of greatness however in his zeal to honor alexander octavian augustus accidentally broke the nose off the macedonian s mummified corpse while laying a wreath at the hero s shrine in alexandria egypt the unbalanced emperor caligula later took the dead king s armor from that tomb and donned it for luck the macriani a roman family that rose to the imperial throne in the three rd century a d always kept images of alexander on their persons either stamped into their bracelets and rings or stitched into their garments even their dinnerware bore alexander s face with the story of the king s life displayed around the rims of special bowls in the summer of one nine nine five during the archaeological work of the season centered on excavating the remains of domestic architecture of early roman date a statue of alexander was recovered from the structure which was richly decorated with mosaic and marble pavements and probably was constructed in the one st century a d and occupied until the three rd century notes one frank l holt alexander the great and the mystery of the elephant medallions university of california press two salima ikram nile currents general timeline alexander s character equestrian statue of alexander the great on the waterfront at thessaloniki capital of greek macedonia modern opinion on alexander has run the gamut from the idea that he believed he was on a divinely inspired mission to unite the human race to the view that he was a megalomaniac bent on world domination such views tend to be anachronistic however and the sources allow for a variety of interpretations much about alexander s personality and aims remains enigmatic alexander is remembered as a legendary hero in europe and much of both southwest asia and central asia where he is known as iskander or iskandar zulkarnain to zoroastrians on the other hand he is remembered as the destroyer of their first great empire and as the leveller of persepolis ancient sources are generally written with an agenda of either glorifying or denigrating the man making it difficult to evaluate his actual character most refer to a growing instability and megalomania in the years following gaugamela but it has been suggested that this simply reflects the greek stereotype of an orientalizing king the murder of his friend clitus which alexander deeply and immediately regretted is often cited as a sign of his paranoia as is his execution of philotas and his general parmenion for failure to pass along details of a plot against him however this may have been more prudence than paranoia modern alexandrists continue to debate these same issues among others in modern times one unresolved topic involves whether alexander was actually attempting to better the world by his conquests or whether his purpose was primarily to rule the world partially in response to the ubiquity of positive portrayals of alexander an alternate character is sometimes presented which emphasizes some of alexander s negative aspects some proponents of this view cite the destructions of thebes tyre persepolis and gaza as examples of atrocities and argue that alexander preferred to fight rather than negotiate it is further claimed in response to the view that alexander was generally tolerant of the cultures of those whom he conquered that his attempts at cultural fusion were severely practical and that he never actually admired persian art or culture to this way of thinking alexander was first and foremost a general rather than a statesman alexander s character also suffers from the interpretation of historians who themselves are subject to the bias and idealisms of their own time good examples are w w tarn who wrote during the late one nine th century and early two zero th century and who saw alexander in an extremely good light and peter green who wrote after world war ii and for whom alexander did little that was not inherently selfish or ambition driven tarn wrote in an age where world conquest and warrior heroes were acceptable even encouraged whereas green wrote with the backdrop of the holocaust and nuclear weapons as a result alexander s character is skewed depending on which way the historian s own culture is and further muddles the debate of who he truly was stories and legends according to one story the philosopher anaxarchus checked the vainglory of alexander when he aspired to the honors of divinity by pointing to alexander s wound saying see the blood of a mortal not the ichor of a god in another version alexander himself pointed out the difference in response to a sycophantic soldier a strong oral tradition although not attested in any extant primary source lists alexander as having epilepsy known to the greeks as the sacred disease and thought to be a mark of divine favor alexander had a legendary horse named bucephalus meaning ox headed supposedly descended from the mares of diomedes alexander himself while still a young boy tamed this horse after experienced horse trainers failed to do so there is an apocryphal tale appearing in a redaction of the pseudo historical alexander romance which details another end for the last true pharaoh of egypt soon after alexander s divinity was confirmed by the oracle of zeus ammon a rumor was begun that nectanebo ii did not travel to nubia but instead to the court of philip ii of macedon in the guise of an egyptian magician he coupled with phillip s wife olympias and from his issue came alexander this myth would hold strong appeal for egyptians who desired continuity in rule and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule another legend tells of alexander s campaign down into the syrian world toward egypt on the way he planned to lay siege to the city of jerusalem as the victorious armies of the greeks approached the city word was brought to the jews in jerusalem that the armies were on their way the high priest at that time who was a godly old man by the name of jaddua mentioned also in the bible book of nehemiah took the sacred writings of daniel the prophet and accompanied by a host of other priests dressed in white garments went forth and met alexander some distance outside the city all this is from the report of josephus the jewish historian who tells us that alexander left his army and hurried to meet this body of priests when he met them he told the high priest that he had had a vision the night before in which god had shown him an old man robed in a white garment who would show him something of great significance to himself according to the account the high priest then opened the prophecies of daniel and read them to alexander in the prophecies alexander was able to see the predictions that he would become that notable goat with the horn in his forehead who would come from the west and smash the power of persia and conquer the world he was so overwhelmed by the accuracy of this prophecy and of course by the fact that it spoke about him that he promised that he would save jerusalem from siege and sent the high priest back with honors ancient sources the ancient sources for alexander s life are from the perspective of ancient history relatively numerous alexander himself left only a few inscriptions and some letter fragments of dubious authenticity but a large number of his contemporaries wrote full accounts the key contemporary historians are considered callisthenes his general ptolemy aristobulus nearchus and onesicritus another influential account was penned by cleitarchus who while not a direct witness of alexander s expedition used the sources which had just been published his work was to be the backbone of that of timagenes who heavily influenced many surviving historians unfortunately all these works were lost instead the modern historian must rely on authors who used these and other early sources the five main accounts are by arrian curtius plutarch diodorus and justin anabasis alexandri the campaigns of alexander in greek by the greek historian arrian of nicomedia writing in the two nd century ad and based largely on ptolemy and to a lesser extent aristobulus and nearchus it is considered generally the most trustworthy source historiae alexandri magni a biography of alexander in ten books of which the last eight survive by the roman historian quintus curtius rufus written in the one st century ad and based largely on cleitarchus through the mediation of timagenes with some material probably from ptolemy life of alexander see parallel lives and two orations on the fortune or the virtue of alexander the great see moralia by the greek historian and biographer plutarch of chaeronea in the second century based largely on aristobulus and especially cleitarchus bibliotheca historia library of world history written in greek by the sicilian historian diodorus siculus from which book one seven relates the conquests of alexander based almost entirely on timagenes s work the books immediately before and after on philip and alexander s successors throw light on alexander s reign the epitome of the philippic history of pompeius trogus by justin which contains factual errors and is highly compressed it is difficult in this case to understand the source since we only have an epitome but it is thought that also pompeius trogus may have limited himself to use timagenes for his latin history to these five main sources some like to add the metz epitome an anonymous late latin work that narrates alexander s campaigns from hyrcania to india much is also recounted incidentally in other authors including strabo athenaeus polyaenus aelian and others the problem of the sources is the main concern and chief delight of alexander historians in effect each presents a different alexander with details to suit arrian is mostly interested in the military aspects while curtius veers to a more private and darker alexander plutarch can t resist a good story light or dark all with the possible exception of arrian include a considerable level of fantasy prompting strabo to remark all who wrote about alexander preferred the marvellous to the true nevertheless the sources tell us much and leave much to our interpretation and imagination alexander s legend alexander was a legend in his own time his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis writing after alexander s death another participant onesicritus went so far as to invent a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons when onesicritus read this passage to his patron alexander s general and later king lysimachus lysimachus reportedly quipped i wonder where i was at the time in the first centuries after alexander s death probably in alexandria a quantity of the more legendary material coalesced into a text known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to the historian callisthenes and therefore known as pseudo callisthenes this text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout antiquity and the middle ages exhibiting a plasticity unseen in higher literary forms latin and syriac translations were made in late antiquity from these versions were developed in all the major languages of europe and the middle east including armenian georgian persian arabic turkish hebrew serbian slavonic romanian hungarian german english italian and french the romance is regarded by most western scholars as the source of the account of alexander given in the qur an sura the cave it is the source of many incidents in ferdowsi s shahnama a mongolian version is also extant some believe that excepting certain religious texts it is the most widely read work of pre modern times alexander s legend in non western sources alexander was often identified in persian and arabic language sources as dhul qarnayn arabic for the two horned one possibly a reference to the appearance of a horn headed figure that appears on coins minted during his rule and later imitated in ancient middle eastern coinage if this theory is followed islamic accounts of the alexander legend particularly in the qur an and in persian legends combined the pseudo callisthenes legendary pseudo religious material about alexander the same legends from the pseudo callisthenes were combined in persia with sasanid persian ideas about alexander in the

lakeville connecticut usa he is probably best remembered for developing the theory of general semantics early life and career he came from an aristocratic family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations and he chose to train as an engineer korzybski was educated at the warsaw university of technology during the first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army after being wounded in his leg and suffering other injuries he came to north america in one nine one six first to canada then the united states to coordinate the shipment of artillery to the war front he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds following the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming a naturalized citizen in one nine four zero his first book manhood of humanity was published in one nine two one in the book he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind mankind as a time binding class of life general semantics korzybski s work culminated in the founding of a discipline that he called general semantics gs as korzybski explicitly said gs should not be confused with semantics a different subject the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are outlined in science and sanity published in one nine three three in one nine three eight korzybski founded the institute of general semantics and directed it until his death in simplified form the essence of korzybski s work was the claim that human beings are limited in what they know by one the structure of their nervous systems and two the structure of their languages human beings cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions nonverbal impressions or gleanings derived from the nervous system and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language sometimes our perceptions and our languages actually mislead us as to the facts with which we must deal our understanding of what is going on sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually going on he stressed training in awareness of abstracting using techniques that he had derived from his study of mathematics and science he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting his system included modifying the way we approach the world e g with an attitude of i don t know let s see to better discover or reflect its realities as shown by modern science one of these techniques involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience that he called silence on the objective levels korzybski and to be it is often said that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be an unfortunate exaggeration he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure e g a statement such as joe is a fool said of a person named joe who has done something that we regard as dumb korzybski s remedy was to deny identity in this example to be continually aware that joe is not what we call him we find joe not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain this was expressed in korzybski s most famous premise the map is not the territory note that the map is not the territory uses the phrase is not a form of the verb to be this example shows that he did not intend to abandon the verb as such anecdote about korzybski one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he suddenly interrupted the lesson in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit a few students took a biscuit nice biscuit don t you think said korzybski while he took a second one the students were chewing vigorously then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging on it was a big picture of a dog s head and the words dog cookies the students looked at the package and were shocked two of them wanted to throw up put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet you see ladies and gentlemen korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people don t just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter apparently his prank aimed to illustrate how human suffering originates from the confusion or conflation of linguistic representations of reality and reality itself source r diekstra haarlemmer dagblad one nine nine three cited by l derks j hollander essenties van nlp utrecht servire one nine nine six p five eight impact korzybski s work

is a popular vector based video arcade game released in one nine seven nine by atari the object of the game is for the player to shoot and destroy asteroids without being hit by the fragments it was one of the most popular and influential games of the golden age of arcade games description asteroids was inspired in a roundabout way by the seminal spacewar the first computer based video game in the early one nine eight zero s a stand up arcade game version was produced as space wars which included a number of optional versions and added a floating asteroid as a visual device asteroids is essentially a one player version of spacewar featuring the wedge ship from the original and promoting the asteroids to be the main opponent the game was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg asteroids was a hit in the united states and became one of atari s best selling games of all time atari had been in the process of releasing a vector beam version of lunar lander but demand for asteroids was so high they simply pulled them apart and converted them over today the lunar lander version is difficult to find asteroids was so popular that video arcade owners usually had to install larger boxes to hold all the coins this machine raked in one feature of the game was the ability for players to record their initials with their high scores an innovation which is standard in arcade games to this day asteroids was the first of several games to use atari s quadra scan vector refresh system although a raster based full color version was developed for the atari two six zero zero home video game system later full color quadra scan games would include tempest features the player s controls consisted of thrust and fire buttons and rotate left rotate right buttons actually rotate counterclockwise and rotate clockwise respectively the momentum of the player s ship was not conserved and it would start to slow down if thrust was not applied there was also a hyperspace button which randomly teleported the player s ship somewhere on the screen with the risk of exploding upon rematerialization or rematerializing inside an asteroid the player s ship spawned in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids drifting around each large asteroid two zero points would break into two medium sized ones five zero points when shot which in turn would break into two small one zero zero points asteroids the medium and small asteroids once spawned could travel at widely varying speeds periodically one of two types of flying saucers ufos would fly onto the screen the big one worth two zero zero points would shoot in random directions while the small one one zero zero zero points would attempt to aim at the player they tended to appear more often when few asteroids remained on the screen and or the player hadn t shot an asteroid recently the screen wrapped around allowing the player s ship as well as asteroids and shots but not saucers to fly off the one edge of the screen and reappear on the opposite side once a level had been cleared of all asteroids and ufos a new set of large asteroids would appear increasing by two each round up to a maximum of one two the maximum score possible was nine nine nine nine zero points after which it turned back over to zero a player who desired to get onto the top score list then had to be careful to shoot just enough asteroids ufos to reach this score without going over including committing suicide with the last ship left to reach the final total on some early versions of the game it was possible to hide the ship in the score area indefinitely without being hit by asteroids lurking the small ufo is the key to high scores for many advanced players soon after the release of asteroids some players discovered that small ufos would be continually sent out when the asteroid count decreased to a certain level since these ufos were worth one zero zero zero points each a significant sum on this game a strategy known as lurking soon developed around this players would shoot asteroids until there was only one small or mid sized rock remaining and then maneuver the ship to a spot approximately one inch from any corner of the screen small ufos would then be ambushed as soon as they emerged and before they were able to return fire using wraparound fire if necessary because the small ufos were unable to lead the player s ship with their fire i e aiming ahead of the ship s flight path a clever player could manuever if necessary in such a way as to virtually ensure they would never be hit by the small ufo in fact the large ufo in a sense was seen as more of a threat precisely because of its unpredictable random shots since each one zero zero zero zero points awarded an extra life players could continue almost indefinitely once the practice had been mastered the designers abolished this practice in asteroids deluxe by causing the ufos to either shoot at the remaining asteroids thus ending the round or shoot at the player as soon as they appeared on the screen they also gained the ability to lead the player s ship as well making them much more dangerous however it was also possible to succeed by shooting the asteroids instead a shrewd asteroid hunting player would typically attempt to kill all the asteroids inside a large one before shooting another asteroid thus minimizing the amount of clutter on the screen technical description the asteroids arcade machine is a so called vector game this means that the game graphics are composed entirely of lines which are drawn on a vector monitor the hardware consists primarily of a standard mos six five zero two cpu which executes the game program and the digital vector generator dvg vector processing circuitry developed by atari themselves as the six five zero two by itself was too slow to control both the game play and the vector hardware at the same time the latter task was delegated to the dvg for each picture frame the six five zero two writes graphics commands for the dvg into a defined area of ram the vector ram and then asks the dvg to draw the corresponding vector image on the screen the dvg reads the commands and generates appropriate signals for the vector monitor there are dvg commands for positioning the cathode ray for drawing a line to a specified destination calling a subroutine with further commands and so on asteroids also features various sound effects each of which is implemented by its own circuitry the cpu activates these audio circuits and other hardware components by writing to special memory addresses memory mapped ports the inputs from the player s controls buttons are also mapped into the cpu address space the main asteroids game program uses only four kb of rom code another four kb of vector rom contain the descriptions of the main graphical elements rocks saucer player s ship explosion pictures letters and digits in the form of dvg commands legacy the gameplay in asteroids was imitated by many games that followed for example one of the objects of sinistar is to shoot asteroids in order to get them to release resources which the player needs to collect due to its success asteroids was followed by three sequels asteroids deluxe one nine eight zero space duel one nine eight two blasteroids one nine eight seven however the original game was by far the most popular of the series the killer list of videogames klov credits this game as one of the top one zero zero videogames readers of the klov credit it as the seventh most popular game ports being one of the most popular video games ever asteroids has been ported to multiple systems including many of atari s systems atari two six zero zero five two zero zero seven eight zero zero atari lynx and many others the two six zero zero port was the first game to utilize a bank switched cartridge doubling available rom space also a new version of asteroids was developed for playstation nintendo six four windows and the game boy color in the late one nine nine zero s a port was also included on atari s cosmos system but the system never saw release many of the recent tv games series of old atari games have

classification systems separate some of the families listed below into additional orders including orders orchidales and iridales while other systems especially the angiosperm phylogeny group s

botanists and was updated as the apg ii in two zero zero two to include recent findings especially in dna analysis their one nine nine eight scheme identified two nine families in order asparagales the apg ii consolidates some families and recognizes an alternative system of fewer larger families in which certain smaller families can be grouped within other larger families based on close genetic affinities and still follow the apg system under the new classification system one could for example correctly include daylilies hemerocallis in family hemerocallidaceae or in family xanthorrhoeaceae the apg ii classification of the asparagales is as follows alliaceae agapanthaceae amaryllidaceae asparagaceae agavaceae aphyllanthaceae hesperocallidaceae hyacinthaceae laxmanniaceae ruscaceae

comprised of herbaceous non succulent plants these plants are commonly found in aquatic environmments the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm traditionally the order alismatales was restricted to contain just three families alismataceae butomaceae and limnocharitaceae the other families were not considered as alismatids and were assigned to various distinct orders but this approach produced polyphyletic groups and so the whole group of families is now placed into a single order the petrosaviaceae have been placed in this order but their actual affinity is not so clear the alismatids have been considered the sister group of the arales and the latter are now included here as a result of this merger the araceae became the most important

the order is cosmopolitic and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees lobelia and shrubs is also present the asterales can be characterized on the morphological and molecular level synapomorphies include the oligosaccharide inulin as the nutrients storage and the stamens are usually aggregated densely around the style or even are fused into a tube around it the

the characteristics of their orbits and on the details of the spectrum of sunlight they reflect orbit groups and families main articles asteroid family and minor planet many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are much tighter and result from the catastrophic break up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past for a full listing of known asteroid groups and families see minor planet and asteroid family spectral classification two five three mathilde a c type asteroid in one nine seven five an asteroid taxonomic system based on colour albedo and spectral shape was developed by clark r chapman david morrison and ben zellner these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid s surface material originally they classified only three types of asteroids c type asteroids carbonaceous seven five of known asteroids s type asteroids silicaceous one seven of known asteroids m type asteroids metallic most of the remaining asteroids this list has since been expanded to include a number of other asteroid types the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied see asteroid spectral types for more detail or for a list note that the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals problems with spectral classification originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid s composition c carbonaceous s silicaceous m metallic however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and there are a variety of classifications in use this has led to significant confusion while asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials at present the spectral classification based on several coarse resolution spectroscopic surveys in the one nine nine zero s is still the standard scientists have been unable to agree on a better taxonomic system largely due to the difficulty of obtaining detailed measurements consistently for a large sample of asteroids e g finer resolution spectra or non spectral data such as densities would be very useful asteroid discovery historical discovery methods asteroid discovery methods have drastically improved over the past two centuries in the last years of the one eight th century baron franz xaver von zach organized a group of two four astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about two eight au from the sun by the titius bode law partly as a consequence of the discovery by sir william herschel in one seven eight one of the planet uranus at the distance predicted by the law this task required that hand drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the zodiacal band down to an agreed upon limit of faintness on subsequent nights the sky would be charted again and any moving object would hopefully be spotted the expected motion of the missing planet was about three zero seconds of arc per hour readily discernable by observers ironically the first asteroid one ceres was not discovered by a member of the group but rather by accident in one eight zero one by giuseppe piazzi director at the time of the observatory of palermo in sicily he discovered a new star like object in taurus and followed the displacement of this object during several nights his colleague carl friedrich gauss used these observations to determine the exact distance from this unknown object to the earth gauss calculations placed the object between the planets mars and jupiter piazzi named it after ceres the roman goddess of agriculture three other asteroids two pallas three juno four vesta were discovered over the next few years with vesta found in one eight zero seven after eight more years of fruitless searches most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches however karl ludwig hencke persisted and began searching for more asteroids in one eight three zero fifteen years later he found five astraea the first new asteroid in three eight years he also found six hebe less than two years later after this other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that except the wartime year one nine four five notable asteroid hunters of this early era were j r hind annibale de gasparis robert luther h m s goldschmidt jean chacornac james ferguson norman robert pogson e w tempel j c watson c h f peters a borrelly j palisa paul henry and prosper henry and auguste charlois in one eight nine one however max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long exposure photographic plates this drastically increased the rate of detection compared with previous visual methods wolf alone discovered two four eight asteroids beginning with three two three brucia whereas only slightly more than three zero zero had been discovered up to that point still a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them calling them vermin of the skies modern discovery methods until one nine nine eight asteroids were discovered by a four step process first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide field telescope pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days second the two films of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope any body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films under the stereoscope the image of the body would appear to float slightly above the background of stars third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope the location would be measured relative to known star locations these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a code of two letters representing the week of discovery and of a number so more than the one discovered one took place in this week example one nine nine eight fj seven four the final step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to brian marsden of the minor planet center dr marsden has computer programs that compute whether an apparition ties together previous apparitions into a single orbit if so the object gets a number the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and he gets the honour of naming the asteroid subject to the approval of the international astronomical union once it is numbered latest technology detecting hazardous asteroids there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earth s orbit and that could given enough time collide with earth see earth crosser asteroids the three most important groups of near earth asteroids are the apollos amors and the atens various asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the near earth asteroid four three three eros had been discovered as long ago as one eight nine eight and the one nine three zero s brought a flurry of similar objects in order of discovery these were one two two one amor one eight six two apollo two one zero one adonis and finally six nine two three zero hermes which approached within zero zero zero five au of the earth in one nine three seven astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact two events in later decades increased the level of alarm the increasing acceptance of walter alvarez theory of dinosaur extinction being due to an impact event and the one nine nine four observation of comet shoemaker levy nine crashing into jupiter the u s military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to one zero metres across all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient automated systems that consist of charge coupled device ccd cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes since one nine nine eight a large majority of the asteroids have been discovered by such automated systems a list of teams using such automated systems includes the lincoln near earth asteroid research linear team the near earth asteroid tracking neat team spacewatch the lowell observatory near earth object search loneos team the catalina sky survey css the campo imperatore near earth objects survey cineos team the japanese spaceguard association the asiago dlr asteroid survey adas the linear system alone has discovered six two two eight three asteroids as of december one four two zero zero five between all of the automated systems three eight six eight near earth asteroids have been discovered including over six zero zero more than one km in diameter naming asteroids the naming format newly discovered asteroids are given a provisional designation consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code such as two zero zero one fh when its orbit is confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name e g one ceres the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number e g four three three eros however dropping the parentheses is quite common informally especially when a name is repeated in running text it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention the minor planet circular mpc of october one nine two zero zero five was a historical one as it saw the highest numbered asteroid jump from nine nine nine four seven to one one eight one six one causing a small y two k like crisis for various automated data services up until then only five digits were allowed in most data formats for the asteroid number this has been addressed in some data fields by having the leftmost digit the ten thousands place use the alphabet as a digit extension a one zero b one one z three five a three six z six one the highest number one two zero four three seven thus is cross referenced as c zero four three seven on some lists also the fictional asteroid of the little prince b six one two now could be connected with the real one one zero six one two two zero zero one ta one four two which is listed as b zero six one two two zero zero one ta one four two in the compacted lists although it is already present as four six six one zero b sixdouze b six one two in hexadecimal translates to four six six one zero in decimal notation unnamed asteroids unnamed asteroids that have been given a number keep their provisional designation e g two nine zero seven five one nine five zero da as modern discovery techniques have discovered vast numbers of new asteroids they are increasingly being left unnamed the first asteroid to be left unnamed was three three six zero one nine eight one va on rare occasions an asteroid s provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the still unnamed one five seven six zero one nine nine two qb gave its name to a group of asteroids which became known as cubewanos sources for names the first few asteroids were named after figures from graeco roman mythology but as such names started to run out others were used famous people literary characters the names of the discoverer s wives children and even television characters the first asteroid to be given a non mythological name was two zero massalia named after the city of marseilles for some time only female or feminized names were used alexander von humboldt was the first man to have an asteroid named after him but his name was feminized to five four alexandra this unspoken tradition lasted until three three four chicago was named even then oddly feminised names show up in the list for years afterward as the number of asteroids began to run into the hundreds and eventually the thousands discoverers began to give them increasingly frivolous names the first hints of this were four eight two petrina and four eight three seppina named after the discoverer s pet dogs however there was little controversy about this until one nine seven one upon the naming of two three zero nine mr spock which was not even named after the star trek character but after the discoverer s cat who supposedly bore a resemblance to him although the iau subsequently banned pet names as sources eccentric asteroid names are still being proposed and accepted such as six zero four two cheshirecat nine zero zero seven james bond or two six eight five eight misterrogers for a full list see meanings of asteroid names special naming rules asteroid naming is not always a free for all there are some types of asteroid for which rules have developed about the sources of names for instance centaurs asteroids orbiting between saturn and neptune are all named after mythological centaurs trojans after heroes from the trojan war and trans neptunian objects after underworld spirits asteroid symbols the first few asteroids discovered were assigned symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate earth the moon the sun and planets the symbols quickly became ungainly hard to draw and recognise by the end of one eight five one there were one five known asteroids each except one with its own symbol the first four s main variants are shown here one ceres old planetary symbol of ceres variant symbol of ceres sickle variant symbol of ceres other sickle variant symbol of ceres two pallas old symbol of pallas variant symbol of pallas three juno old symbol of juno other symbol of juno four vesta old symbol of vesta old planetary symbol of vesta modern astrological symbol of vesta johann franz encke made a major change in the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch baj berlin astronomical yearbook for one eight five four he introduced encircled numbers instead of symbols although his numbering began with astraea the first four asteroids continuing to be denoted by their traditional symbols this symbolic innovation was adopted very quickly by the astronomical community the following year one eight five five astraea s number was bumped up to five but ceres through vesta would be listed by their numbers only in the one eight six seven edition a few more asteroids two eight bellona three five leukothea and three seven fides would be given symbols as well as using the numbering scheme the circle would become a pair of parentheses and the parentheses sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades for details see james l hilton two zero zero one when did the asteroids

first close up photographs of asteroid like objects were taken in one nine seven one when the mariner nine probe imaged phobos and deimos the two small moons of mars which are probably captured

speak out formally in the field of apologetics allocution is generally done in defense of a belief in politics one may allocute before a legislative body in an effort to influence their position on an issue in law it is generally meant to state specifically and in detail what one did and or why often in relation to commission of a crime in most jurisdictions a defendant is allowed the opportunity to allocute that is explain himself before sentence is passed some jurisdictions hold this as an absolute right and in its absence a sentence may potentially be overturned with the result that a new sentencing hearing must be held allocution is sometimes required of a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime in a plea bargain in exchange for a reduced sentence in this instance allocution can serve to provide closure for victims or their families in principle it removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant s guilt in the matter however there have been many cases in which the defendant allocuted to a crime that he did not commit often because this is a requirement to receiving a lesser sentence the term allocution is generally only in use in jurisdictions in the united states though there are similar processes in other nations see also confession law an affidavit is a formal sworn statement of fact written down signed and witnessed as to the veracity of the signature by a taker of oaths such as a notary public the name is medieval latin for he has declared upon oath one use of affidavits is to allow evidence to be gathered from witnesses or participants that may not be available to testify in person before the court in american jurisprudence it is very unusual to allow an unsupported affidavit to be entered into evidence as the person sworn in the affidavit is not subject to cross examination with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence a formerly written affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts closer in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witness recollection materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence some types of motions will not be accepted by a court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion in such a case the court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion as certain assumptions are made to wit the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes judicial economy the lawyer is an officer of the court and knows that a false swearing by him if found out could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including disbarment the lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit in the united kingdom affidavits are made by writing i state full name of insert address on this date date in words make oath and say as follows after this has been written the facts to be sworn are listed in pros or in bullet points the document is then taken to a commisssioner for oaths most solicitors are also commissioners for oaths they will then ask you to swear on a holy book particular to your faith the new testament the old testament the qur an etc and ask you to verify what has been stated an affidavit is of equivalent value to sworn testimony evidence legal documents

constellation s northern corner and ngc one one five six northwest of mythology when including fainter stars visible to the naked eye the area resembles the head of a ram having a general herbivore head shape and a spiral horn in greek mythology this is believed to represent the ram which carried athamas s son phrixus and daughter helle to colchis to escape their stepmother ino helle fell off into the sea which later became the hellespont on reaching safety phrixis sacrificed the ram and hung its fleece in the grove of ares where it turned to gold and later became the quest of jason and the argonauts it appears that babylonians greeks persians and egyptians all agreed on the name of the ram for this constellation the main area of the sky constituting the sign of aries containing part

six six zero depending on the preferred definition based on the modern constellation boundaries of pisces and aquarius the age of aquarius would begin around two six six zero however with so much of modern society reflecting the qualities of aquarius most astrologers believe that this era has begun mass production electricity flight and space travel electronic communications including computers the internet even the growing movement against capitalism in favour of a more socialist system of humanitarian development are all related to the aquarian paradigm mythology the best known myth identifies aquarius with ganymede a beautiful youth with whom zeus fell in love and whom he in the guise of an eagle represented as the constellation aquila carried off to olympus to be cupbearer to the gods crater is sometimes identified as his cup aquarius generally resembles the figure of a man and when considering fainter humanly visible stars it takes on the image of a man with a bucket from which is pouring a stream aquarius was also identified as the pourer of the waters which flooded the earth in the great flood in the ancient greek version of the myth as such the constellation eridanus was sometimes identified as being a river poured out by aquarius it may also together with the constellation pegasus be part of the origin of the myth of the mares of diomedes which forms one of the twelve labours of heracles its association with pouring out rivers and the nearby constellation of capricornus may be the source of the myth of the augean stable which forms another of the

and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers storylines may feature a variety of characters and may be set in different locations and in different eras anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different genres that any series may be categorised under anime may be broadcast on television distributed on media such as dvds or published as console and computer games anime is often influenced by japanese comics known as manga anime may also be adapted into live action television programs a scene from cowboy bebop one nine nine eight toc history atom star of the long running science fiction series mighty atom also known as astro boy to western audiences the history of anime begins at the start of the two zero th century when japanese filmmakers experimented with the animation techniques that were being explored in the west during the one nine seven zero s anime developed further separating itself from its western roots and developing unique genres such as mecha in the one nine eight zero s anime was accepted in the mainstream in japan and experienced a boom in production the one nine nine zero s and two zero zero zero s saw an increased acceptance of anime in overseas markets terminology the japanese term for animation is anim shon pronounced written in katakana it is a direct transliteration and reborrowed loanword of the english term animation the japanese term is abbreviated as anime pronounced both the original and abbreviated forms are valid and interchangeable in japanese but as could be expected the abbreviated form is more commonly used the term is a broad one and does not specify an animation s nation of origin or style pronunciation the english word anime is a transliteration of the abbreviated version of this japanese term and it is typically pronounced as or ann ih may ah nee may is a less common variant some theorize the word comes from the french anim animated or les dessins anim s animated drawings and pronounce it as ah nee may though the japanese themselves deny this theory and the fact that it is written in japanese syllables as anime rather than animei further lowers its credibility as with a few other japanese words such as pok mon and kobo ab anime is sometimes spelled as anim in english with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader that the letter is pronounced as hence the pronunciations ah neem and uh neem are generally considered incorrect syntax anime can be used as a common noun do you watch anime or as a suppletive adjective the anime guyver is different from the movie guyver it may also be used as a mass noun as in how much anime have you collected and therefore is never pluralized animes nouns are never pluralized in japanese synonyms anime is sometimes referred to by the blend word japanimation but this term has fallen into disuse it saw the most usage during the one nine seven zero s and one nine eight zero s which broadly comprise the first and second waves of anime fandom the term survived at least into the early one nine nine zero s but seemed to fade away shortly before the mid one nine nine zero s anime resurgence in general the term now only appears in nostalgic contexts the term is much more commonly used within japan to refer to domestic animation since anime or anim shon is used to describe all forms of animation japanimation is used to distinguish japanese work from that of the rest of the world in more recent years anime has also frequently been referred to as manga in europe a practice that may stem from the japanese usage in japan manga can refer to both animation and comics although the use of manga to refer to animation is mostly restricted to non fans among english speakers manga usually has the stricter meaning of japanese comics an alternate explanation is that it is due to the prominence of manga entertainment a distributor of anime to the us and uk markets because manga entertainment started out in the uk this use of the term is much more common in europe characteristics dragon ball z is one of the most popular sh nen anime anime features a wide variety of artistic styles which vary from artist to artist and is characterized by stark colorful graphics and stylized colorful images depicting vibrant characters in a variety of different settings and storylines aimed at a wide range of audiences genres anime has many genres with as many as traditional live action cinema such genres include adventure science fiction children s stories romance medieval fantasy erotica hentai occult horror action and drama most anime includes content from several different genres as well as a variety of thematic elements this can make categorizing some titles very difficult a show may have a seemingly simple surface plot but at the same time may feature a far more complex deeper storyline and character development it is not uncommon for a strongly action themed anime to also involve humor romance and even poignant social commentary the same can be applied to a romance themed anime in that it may involve a strong action element genres and designations that are specific to anime and manga for other possible genres see list of movie genres bish jo japanese for beautiful girl blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty girl characters for example magic knight rayearth bish nen japanese for beautiful boy blanket term that can be used to describe any anime that features pretty and elegant boys and men for example fushigi y gi ecchi japanese for indecent sexuality contains mild sexual humor for example love hina hentai japanese for abnormal or perverted and used by western audiences to refer to pornographic anime or erotica however in japan the term used to refer to the same material is typically poruno or ero josei japanese for young woman this is anime or manga that is aimed at young women and is one of the rarest forms kodomo japanese for child this is anime or manga that is aimed at young children for example doraemon mecha anime or manga featuring giant robots example mobile suit gundam mo anime or manga featuring characters that are extremely perky or cute for example little snow fairy sugar progressive art films or extremely stylized anime for example voices of a distant star seinen anime or manga similar to sh nen but targeted at teenage or young male adults for example oh my goddess sentai super sentai literally fighting team in japanese refers to any show that involves a superhero team for example cyborg zero zero nine sh jo japanese for young lady or little girl refers to anime or manga targeted at girls for example fruits basket mah sh jo subgenre of shoujo known for magical girl stories for example sailor moon sh jo ai japanese for girl love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between female characters for example revolutionary girl utena sh nen japanese for boys refers to anime or manga targeted at boys for example dragon ball z sh nen ai japanese for boy love refers to anime or manga that focus on love and romance between male characters this term is being phased out in japan due to references to pedophilia and is being replaced by the term boys love bl an example of this style is gravitation some anime titles are written for a very specific audience even narrower than those described above for example initial d and x driver concern street racing and car tuning ashita no joe is about boxing hanaukyo maid team is based on the french maid fantasy recently the national child exploitation coordination centre of canada has incorrectly classified all anime as hentai giving an improper impression of the content of most anime and manga series this occurred despite having linked to this wikipedia page in order to establish a definition of terms the site can be viewed at the following link complaints about the article s content and improper citations caused the ncecc to revise the citations but not the content music much like western live action cinema anime uses music as an important artistic tool anime soundtracks are big business in japan and are often times met with similar demand as chart topping pop albums it is for this reason that anime music is often composed and performed by a list musicians stars and composers skilled bgm composers are highly respected in the anime fan community anime series with opening credits use the opening theme song as a quick introduction to the show the most frequent use of music in anime is background music or bgm bgm is used to set the tone of a given scene for example neon genesis evangelion s decisive battle is played when the characters are making battle preparations and it features heavy drum beats and a militaristic style which highlights the tension of the scene and hints at the action to follow the theme song also referred to as the opening song or abbreviated as op usually matches the overall tone of the show and serves to get the viewer excited about the upcoming program insert songs and ending songs abbr ed often make commentary about the plot or the program as a whole and are often times used to highlight a particularly important scene opening and ending themes as well as insert songs are frequently performed by popular musicians or japanese idols so in this way songs become a very important component of an anime program in addition to the themes the seiy for a specific anime also frequently releases cd for their character called image albums despite the word image in the cd s name it only contains music and or voice messages where the seiy talks with the audience or about herself making the listener think that the character him herself is singing another type of anime cds release are drama cd featuring songs and tracks which makes use of the seiy to tell a story often not included in the main anime animation style lum from urusei yatsura an iconic anime character the drawing style used in anime is counter productive to the animation process having far too many details and subsequently making it difficult to keep the number of drawings comparable to other cartoons with design ethics that stress simplicity this may be due to a philosophy of applying more effort into each of a few drawings than less effort into one of many osamu tezuka adapted and simplified many disney animation precepts to reduce the budget costs and number of frames in the production though it should be noted that disney films made in the west are not anime this was intended to be a temporary measure to allow him to produce one episode every week with an inexperienced animation staff anime studios have since perfected techniques to draw as little new animation as possible using scrolling or repeating backgrounds still shots of characters sliding across the screen and dialogue which involves only animating mouths while the rest of the screen remains absolutely still a technique not wholly unfamiliar to western animation the overall effect of these techniques such as reduced frame rate several still shots and scrolling backgrounds has led some critics to accuse anime of choppiness or poor quality in general see also limited animation there are often scenes where the frame rate of the animation far exceeds the quality of the rest of the production these are commonly referred to as money shots outside of japan where more effort is put into the animation of one scene to give it emphasis over the rest of the work animator yasuo otsuka was the pioneer of this technique exceptions to these rules are early classic films such as those produced by toei animation up until the mid one nine six zero s and recent big budget films such as those produced by the enormously successful studio ghibli these movies have much higher production values due to their anticipated success at the box office some animators in japan overcome production values by utilizing different techniques than the disney or the old tezuka otsuka methods of animating anime directors such as hiroyuki imaishi cutey honey dead leaves simplify backgrounds so that more attention can be paid to character animation other animators like tatsuyuki tanaka in koji minamoto s eternal family in particular use squash and stretch an animation technique not often used by japanese animators tanaka makes other shortcuts to compensate for this some higher budgeted television and ova original video animation series also forego the shortcuts found in most other anime while different titles and different artists have their own unique artistic styles many stylistic elements have become extremely common some examples have become so common that they are often described as being definitive of anime in general and have been given names of their own the most common is the large eyes style drawn on many anime characters common mainly due to the influence of osamu tezuka who was inspired by the exaggerated features of western cartoon characters such as betty boop and mickey mouse and from disney s bambi tezuka found that large eyes allowed his characters to better express their emotions some western audiences have interpreted such stylized eyes as more caucasian cultural anthropologist matt thorn argues that japanese animators and audiences do not perceive them as inherently more or less foreign when tezuka began drawing ribbon no kishi the first manga specifically targeted at young girls tezuka further exaggerated the size of the characters eyes indeed through ribbon no kishi tezuka set a stylistic template that later sh jo artists tended to follow another variation of this style is chibi or super deformed which usually feature huge eyes an enlarged head and small body other stylistic elements are common as well often in comedic anime characters that are shocked or surprised will perform a face fault in which they display an extremely exaggerated expression angry characters may exhibit a vein or stressmark effect where lines representing bulging veins will appear on their forehead angry women will sometimes summon a mallet from nowhere and strike someone with it leading to the concept of hammerspace male characters will develop a bloody nose around their female love interests typically to indicate arousal this is supposedly due to blood rushing to the face in an exaggerated blush embarrassed characters will invariably produce a massive sweat drop which has become something of a stereotype of anime the degree of stylization varies from title to title some titles make extensive use of common stylization flcl for example is known for its wild exaggerated stylization in contrast titles such as only yesterday a film by isao takahata take a much more realistic approach and feature no stylistic exaggerations another unique aspect of anime not found in other commercial animation markets is the lack of a directoral system in most animation produced around the world animators are all forced to conform to a set style by the director or animation director in japan starting with the animation director yoshinori kanada as a means to save time and money each animator brings his her own style to the work the most extreme examples of this can be found in mindgame or the hakkenden the hakkenden is particularly extreme showing constantly shifting styles of animation based upon the key animator that worked on that particular episode this approach combined with otsuka s money shots make key animators important individuals in the style and production of an anime film many non japanese cartoons are starting to incorporate mainstream anime shortcuts and symbols to appeal to anime s tremendously growing fanbase and cut costs production types of anime most anime can be categorized as one of three types films which are generally released in theaters represent the highest budgets and generally the highest video quality popular anime movies include akira ghost in the shell and spirited away some anime films are only released at film or animation festivals and are shorter and sometimes lower in production values some examples of these are winter days and osamu tezuka s legend of the forest other types of films include compilation movies which are television episodes edited together and presented in theaters for various reasons and are hence a concentrated form of a television serial these may however be longer than the average movie there are also theatrical shorts derived from existing televisions series and billed in japanese theaters together to form feature length showing television series anime is syndicated and broadcast on television on a regular schedule television series are generally low quality compared to ova original video animation and film titles because the production budget is spread out over many episodes rather than a single film or a short series most episodes are about two three minutes in length to fill a typical thirty minute time slot with added commercials one full season is two six episodes and many titles run half seasons or one three episodes most tv series anime episodes will have opening credits closing credits and often an eyecatch a very short scene often humorous or silly that is used to signal the start or end of the commercial break as bumpers in the united states are used in a similar fashion eyecatch scenes are often found in tv series anime and are generally similar throughout the series ova original video animation sometimes oav or original animated video anime is often similar to a television miniseries ovas are typically two to twenty episodes in length one shots are particularly short usually less than film length they are most commonly released directly to video as a general rule ova anime tends to be of high quality approaching that of films titles often have a very regular continuous plot best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence popular ova titles include flcl bubblegum crisis and tenchi muyo opening credits closing credits and eyecatches may sometimes be found in ova releases but not universally franchising it is very common for one title to spawn several different releases a title that starts as a popular television series might then have a movie produced at a later date a good example is tenchi muyo originally an ova it spawned three movies three television series and several spinoff titles and specials not all successors to an anime are a sequel to the original story prequels and alternate stories are commonly adapted from the original licensing and distribution anime is available outside of japan in localized form licensed anime is modified by western distributors through dubbing into the language of the country the anime may also be edited to alter cultural references that may not be understood by a non japanese person and companies may remove what may be perceived as objectionable content for the fans who may object to the editing and dubbing of anime dvds may be their preference dvd releases often include both the dubbed audio and the original japanese audio with subtitles are typically unedited and lack commercials fansubs although it is a violation of copyright laws in many countries some fans watch fansubs recordings of anime series that have been subtitled by fans watching subtitled japanese versions is usually seen as the intended method of watching anime by enthusiasts the ethical implications of producing distributing or watching fansubs is a topic of much controversy even when fansub groups do not profit from and cease distribution of their work

one none arabic less formally is the largest member of the semitic branch of the afro asiatic language family classification south central semitic and is closely related to hebrew and aramaic it is spoken throughout the arab world and is widely studied and known throughout the islamic world arabic has been a literary language since at least the six th century and is the liturgical language of islam quite a few english words are ultimately derived from arabic often through other european languages especially spanish among them every day vocabulary like sugar sukkar cotton or magazine more recognizable are words like algebra alcohol and zenith see list of english words of arabic origin literary and modern standard arabic the term arabic may refer either to literary arabic or modern standard arabic or to the many localized varieties of arabic commonly called colloquial arabic arabs consider literary arabic as the standard language and tend to view everything else as mere dialects literary arabic literally the most eloquent arabic language refers both to the language of present day media across north africa and the middle east and to the more articulate language of the qur an the expression media here includes most television and radio and all written matter including all books newspapers magazines documents of every kind and reading primers for small children colloquial or dialectal arabic refers to the many national or regional varieties derived from classical arabic spoken daily across north africa and the middle east which constitute the everyday spoken language these sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible these dialects are not typically written although a certain amount of literature particularly plays and poetry exists in many of them they are often used to varying degrees in informal spoken media such as soap operas and talk shows literary arabic or classical arabic is the official language of all arab countries and is the only form of arabic taught in schools at all stages the sociolinguistic situation of arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia the normal use of two separate varieties of the same language usually in different social situations in the case of arabic educated arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their local dialect and their school taught literary arabic to an equal or lesser degree this diglossic situation facilitates code switching in which a speaker switches back and forth unaware between the two varieties of the language sometimes even within the same sentence in instances in which arabs of different nationalities engage in conversation only to find their dialects mutually unintelligible e g a moroccan speaking with a lebanese both should be able to code switch into literary arabic for the sake of communication since the written arabic of today differs from the written arabic of the qur anic era it has become customary in western scholarship and among non arab scholars of arabic to refer to the language of the qur an as classical arabic and the modern language of the media and of formal speech as modern standard arabic arabs on the other hand often use the term to refer to both forms thus placing greater emphasis on the similarities between the two the difference between arabic of the qur anic era and today s classical arabic is only in the degree of eloquence the vocabulary the syntactic and grammatical rules are the same arabic and islam it is sometimes difficult to translate islamic concepts and concepts specific to arab culture without using the original arabic terminology the qur an is expressed in arabic and traditionally muslims deem it impossible to translate in a way that would adequately reflect its exact meaning indeed until recently some schools of thought maintained that it should not be translated at all a list of islamic terms in arabic covers those terms which are too specific to translate in one phrase while arabic is strongly associated with islam and is the language of salah it is also spoken by arab christians oriental jews and smaller sects such as iraqi mandaeans even so a majority of the world s muslims do not actually speak arabic but only know some fixed phrases of the language such as those used in islamic prayer however to counteract this trend non arabic speaking muslims are strongly encouraged to learn the language classification and related languages maltese which is spoken on the mediterranean island of malta is the only surviving european language to derive primarily from arabic though it contains a large number of italian and english borrowings dialects see varieties of arabic for main article colloquial arabic is a collective term for the spoken languages or dialects of people throughout the arab world which as mentioned differ radically from the literary language the main dialectal division is between the maghreb dialects and those of the middle east followed by that between sedentary dialects and the much more conservative bedouin dialects maltese though descended from arabic is considered a separate language speakers of some of these dialects are unable to converse with speakers of another dialect of arabic in particular while middle easterners can generally understand one another they often have trouble understanding maghrebis although the converse is not true due to the popularity of middle eastern especially egyptian films and other media one factor in the differentiation of the dialects is influence from the languages previously spoken in the areas which have typically provided a significant number of new words and have sometimes also influenced pronunciation or word order however a much more significant factor for most dialects is as among romance languages retention or change of meaning of different classical forms thus iraqi aku levantine fiih and north african kayen all mean there is and all come from arabic yakuun fiihi kaa in respectively but now sound very different the major groups are egyptian arabic maghreb arabic algerian arabic moroccan arabic tunisian arabic and western libyan levantine arabic western syrian lebanese palestinian and western jordanian cypriot maronite arabic iraqi arabic khuzestani arabic which has significant persian influence and is not understood by most other arabic speakers gulf arabic eastern syrian kuwaiti saudi arabian persian gulf coast from iraq to oman including much of saudi arabia s eastern province and minorities on the

bed but centralised i u ai ay au aw allophonically after velarized consonants see following the vowel a is pronounced as thus also after r ai as and au as consonants see arabic alphabet for explanations on the ipa phonetic symbols found in this chart is pronounced as by some speakers this is especially characteristic of the egyptian and southern yemeni dialects in many parts of north africa and in the levant it is pronounced as is pronounced only in the name of god i e allah when the word follows a u or after i or it is unvelarised bismi l l h is usually a phonetic approximant in many varieties if not most are actually epiglottal despite what is reported in many earlier works the consonants traditionally termed emphatic are either velarised or pharyngealised in some transcription systems emphasis is shown by capitalizing the letter e g is written d in others the letter is underlined or has a dot below it e g vowels and consonants can be phonologically short or long long geminate consonants are normally written doubled in latin transcription i e bb dd etc reflecting the presence of the arabic diacritic mark shaddah which marks lengthened consonants such consonants are held twice as long as short consonants this consonant lengthening is phonemically contrastive e g qabala he received and qabbala he kissed syllable structure arabic has two kinds of syllable open syllables cv and cvv and closed syllables cvc cvvc and cvcc every syllable begins with a consonant or else a consonant is borrowed from a previous word through elision especially in the case of the definite article the al used when starting an utterance or l when following a word e g baytu l mudiir house of the director which becomes bay tul mu diir when divided syllabically by itself definite mudiir would be pronounced stress although word stress is not phonemically contrastive in standard arabic it does bear a strong relationship to vowel length and syllable shape and correct word stress aids intelligibility in general heavy syllables attract stress i e syllables of longer duration a closed syllable or a syllable with a long vowel in a word with a syllable with one long vowel the long vowel attracts the stress e g ki taab and kaa tib in a word with two long vowels the second long vowel attracts stress e g ma kaa tiib in a word with a heavy syllable where two consonants occur together or the same consonant is doubled the last heavy syllable attracts stress e g ya ma niyy ka tabt ka tab na ma jal lah mad ra sah yur sil na this last rule trumps the first two ja zaa i riyy otherwise word stress typically falls on the first syllable ya man ka ta bat etc the cairo egyptian arabic dialect however has some idiosyncrasies in that a heavy syllable may not carry stress more than two syllables from the end of a word so that mad ra sah carries the stress on the second to last syllable as does qaa hi rah dialectal variations in some dialects there may be more or fewer phonemes than those listed in the chart above for example non arabic is used in the maghreb dialects as well in the written language mostly for foreign names semitic became extremely early on in arabic before it was written down a few modern arabic dialects such as iraqi influenced by persian distinguish between and interdental fricatives and are rendered as stops and in some dialects principally levantine and egyptian and as and in learned words from the standard language early in the expansion of arabic the separate emphatic phonemes and coallesced into a single phoneme becoming one or the other predictably dialects without interdental fricatives use exclusively while those with such fricatives use again in learned words from the standard language is rendered as in dialects without interdental fricatives another key distinguishing mark of arabic dialects is how they render standard a voiceless uvular stop it retains its original pronunciation in widely scattered regions such as yemen and morocco and among the druze while it is rendered in gulf arabic iraqi arabic upper egypt and less urban parts of the levant e g jordan and as a glottal stop in many prestige dialects such as those spoken in cairo beirut and damascus thus arabs instantly give away their geographical and class origin by their pronunciation of a word such as qamar moon or grammar see arabic grammar writing system main article arabic alphabet the arabic alphabet derives from the aramaic script which variety nabataean or syriac is a matter of scholarly dispute to which it bears a loose resemblance like that of coptic or cyrillic script to greek script traditionally there were several differences between the western maghrebi and eastern version of the alphabet in particular the fa and qaf had a dot underneath and a single dot above respectively in the maghreb and the order of the letters was slightly different at least when they were used as numerals however the old maghrebi variant has been

and efficiently representing arabic with the latin alphabet the more scientific standards allow the reader to recreate the exact word using the arabic alphabet however these systems are heavily reliant on diacritical marks such as for the english sh sound at first sight this may be difficult to recognize less scientific systems often use digraphs like sh and kh which are usually more simple to read but sacrifice the definiteness of the scientific systems in some cases the sh or kh sounds can be represented by italicizing or underlining them that way they can be distinguished from separate s and h sounds or k and h sounds respectively compare gashouse to gash during the last few decades and especially since the one nine nine zero s western invented text communication technologies have become prevalent in the arab world such as personal computers the world wide web email bulletin board systems irc instant messaging and mobile phone text messaging most of these technologies originally had the ability to communicate using the latin alphabet only and some of them still do not have the arabic alphabet as an optional feature as a result arabic speaking users communicated in these technologies by transliterating the arabic text using the latin script sometime known as im arabic to handle those arabic letters that cannot be accurately represented using the latin script numerals and other characters were appropriated for example the numeral three may be used to represent the arabic letter ayn there is no universal name for this type of transliteration

script by john milius rewritten by coppola which was inspired by joseph conrad s classic novella heart of darkness set during the vietnam war the film tells the story of a taciturn american soldier who is sent to terminate with extreme prejudice the command of a rogue united states army special forces colonel the narrative of his journey and its culmination are studded with events which while bizarre are based on real vietnam stories the soldier s journey becomes increasingly nonlinear and hallucinatory coppola s agenda clearly involves larger themes the film s subtext concerns a journey into the darkness of the human psyche the film features performances by martin sheen as captain benjamin l willard marlow in conrad s novel marlon brando as colonel walter e kurtz dennis hopper as a fast talking hallucinogen using photojournalist and robert duvall in an oscar nominated turn as the borderline psychotic lt colonel kilgore several other actors who were or later became prominent stars had minor or supporting roles in the movie including harrison ford r lee ermey and laurence fishburne who only fourteen years old when shooting began in march one nine seven six was credited as larry fishburne the movie poster art for apocalypse now is one of the more famous paintings by bob peak who is considered an influential artist in the world of film when it comes to movie posters background filmed in the philippines most notably the pagsanjan river and hidden valley springs the film went far over budget and schedule a typhoon destroyed many of the sets the philippine air force helicopters used for shooting were constantly called back by president ferdinand marcos to be used in actual combat the lead role was recast martin sheen replaced harvey keitel after shooting had begun sheen then had a near fatal heart attack brando was intractable and out of shape and coppola himself was mentally fragile being similar in appearance and remarkably similar in voice martin sheen s brother joe estevez stood in for the unwell sheen in much of the film and some of the narration is by him after the first edit the film was six hours long and had to be severely edited the original released version was just over two and a half hours long coppola re released the film in two zero zero one under the title apocalypse now redux restoring footage and sequences and lifting the running time to two zero zero minutes recent rumors have persisted that coppola is considering releasing the true original cut on dvd but there has been no fruition or conformation of this for background information on the film see eleanor coppola s documentary hearts of darkness a filmmaker s apocalypse released in one nine nine one synopsis u s army captain benjamin l willard is stationed in saigon a seasoned veteran he is deeply troubled and apparently no longer fit for civilian life a group of intelligence officers approach him with a special mission up river into the remote cambodian jungle to find colonel walter e kurtz a former member of the united states army special forces they state that kurtz once considered a model officer and future general has apparently gone insane and is commanding a legion of his own montagnard troops deep in neutral cambodia their claims are supported by very disturbing radio broadcasts and or recordings made by kurtz himself willard is asked to undertake a mission to find kurtz and dispose of him with extreme prejudice willard studies the intelligence files during the boat ride to the river entrance and learns that kurtz isolated in his compound has assumed the role of a warlord and is worshipped by the natives and his own loyal men another officer sent earlier to kill kurtz has apparently become one of his lieutenants willard will begin his trip up the mekong river on a pbr patrol boat river with an eclectic crew composed of by the book and formal chief phillips a black navy boat commander gm three lance b johnson a tanned all american california surfer gm three tyrone aka clean a black one seven year old from the bronx and the cajun engineman jay chef hicks the village attack scene in apocalypse now the pbr arrives at a landing zone where willard and the crew meet up with lt colonel bill kilgore the merciless commander of the aircav in the region following a massive and hectic mopping up operation of a conquered enemy town kilgore a keen surfer befriends johnson later he learns from one of his men that the beach down the coast which marks the opening to the river is perfect for surfing a factor which persuades him to capture it the problem is his troops say it s charlie s point and heavily fortified dismissing this complaint with the explanation that charlie don t surf kilgore orders his men to saddle up in the morning so that the aircav can capture the town and the beach riding high above the coast in a fleet of hueys accompanied by h six s kilgore launches an attack on the beach the scene famous for its use of richard wagner s epic ride of the valkyries ends with the soldiers surfing the barely claimed beach amidst skirmishes between infantry and vc after helicopters swoop over the village and demolish all visible signs of resistance a giant napalm strike in the nearby jungle dramatically marks the climax of the battle i love the smell of napalm in the morning smells like victory kilgore exults to willard the quote made it to one two onto the american film institute s afi s one zero zero years one zero zero movie quotes a list of top movie quotes i love the smell of napalm in the morning it smells like victory the lighting and mood darken as the boat navigates upstream and willard s silent obsession with kurtz deepens episodes on the journey include a run in with a tiger while willard and chef search for mango fruits an impromptu inspection of a vietnamese sampan that leads to massacre a surreal stop at the last american outpost during a vietnamese attack against a wood bridge under construction there and the shocking deaths of both clean and chief phillips during a gunfire ambush with hidden viet cong soldiers and a spear thrown by a native on the shore respectively once arrived at kurtz s compound willard leaves chef behind with orders to call in an air strike on the village if he does not return they are met by a borderline psychotic freelance photographer hopper who explains kurtz s greatness and philosophic skills to provoke his people into following him brought before kurtz and held in captivity in a darkened temple willard s constitution appears to weaken as kurtz lectures him on his theories of war humanity and civilization kurtz explains his motives and philisophy in a famous and haunting monolgue i ve seen horrors horrors that you ve seen but you have no right to call me a murderer you have a right to kill me you have a right to do that but you have no right to judge me it s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means horror horror has a face and you must make a friend of horror horror and moral terror are your friends if they are not then they are enemies to be feared they are truly enemies i remember when i was with special forces seems a thousand centuries ago we went into a camp to inoculate the children we left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio and this old man came running after us and he was crying he couldn t see we went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm there they were in a pile a pile of little arms and i remember i i i cried i wept like some grandmother i wanted to tear my teeth out i didn t know what i wanted to do and i want to remember it i never want to forget it i never want to forget and then i realized like i was shot like i was shot with a diamond a diamond bullet right through my forehead and i thought my god the genius of that the genius the will to do that perfect genuine complete crystalline pure and then i realized they were stronger than we because they could stand that these were not monsters these were men trained cadres these men who fought with their hearts who had families who had children who were filled with love but they had the strength the strength to do that if i had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly you have to have men who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling without passion without judgment without judgment because it s judgment that defeats us while bound outside in the pouring rain willard is approached by kurtz who places the severed head of chef in his lap coppola makes little explicit but we come to believe that willard and kurtz develop an understanding nonetheless kurtz wishes to die at willard s hands and willard having subsequently granted kurtz his wish is offered the chance to succeed him in his warlord demigod role juxtaposed with a ceremonial slaughtering of a water buffalo willard enters kurtz s chamber during one of his message recordings and kills him with a machete this entire sequence is set to the end by the doors lying bloody and dying on the ground kurtz whispers the horror the horror this line is taken directly from conrad s novella willard walks through the now silent crowd of natives until he comes upon lance who seems to have integrated himself into the society the two of them make their way to the pbr and float away as kurtz s final words echo in the wind as the screen fades to black redux in two zero zero one coppola released apocalypse now redux which restored four nine minutes of scenes that were cut from the original film including stopovers at a french rubber plantation wherein mr clean is buried and a rain soaked american base camp nudity absent from the original was also included in the redux most notably at the french plantation and in an additional scene with the playboy playmates from the uso show in this version willard steals kilgore s surfboard which can still be seen briefly onboard the pbr in the original cut alternate endings coppola denied having any actual alternative endings in the dvd commentary he states that they simply had a massive amount of footage to edit with and thus had some choices to make they did consider using the explosion footage made during their destruction of the kurtz compound but he later decided that implying that the air strike had been called in was contrary to his wish to offer some slight hope that we could overcome the horrors of war however there are multiple slightly varying versions of the ending credits one version from the seven zero mm release ends with no credits and shows the boat pulling away another version for the three five mm wide release rolls the credits while the kurtz compound is destroyed in what must be assumed was an air strike yet another version ends silently without the explosions and the credits roll over a black background themes apocalypse now is a thematically rich film the primary motif of the film is that of heart of darkness i e an odyssey into the darkness of humanity willard s constant narration gives us a glimpse into his fractured psychological state particularly in the opening scenes where he lies in his bed and stares blankly into the ceiling he relates that he is on his second tour of duty and that he returned because he was unable to re integrate himself into civilian life saigon shit i m still only in saigon every time i think i m gonna wake up back in the jungle when i was home after my first tour it was worse i d wake up and there d be nothing i hardly said a word to my wife until i said yes to a divorce when i was here i wanted to be there when i was there all i could think of was getting back into the jungle i m here a week now waiting for a mission getting softer every minute i stay in this room i get weaker and every minute charlie squats in the bush he gets stronger each time i looked around the walls moved in a little tighter this chilling monologue besides suggesting how man is connected to war is also an allusion to post traumatic stress disorder a condition common to many vietnam veterans willard s quest for kurtz s compound parallels kurtz s own descent into madness he never tells his fellow shipmates of the pbr the true purpose of the mission and in a chilling scene after his crew massacres people sailing on a sampan willard murders the surviving girl kurtz who was a committed family man and a highly respected colonel is driven insane after witnessing a vile incident commited by his enemies while on a peacekeeping mission he realised that he can never win the war unless he surrenders his morality and kill without judgment for kurtz this action drove him insane and so he gathered other disillusioned soldiers and started a strange bizarre civilization in the cambodian forest this is a subtle allusion to the bureaucracy that directs soldiers in the war the bureaucrats propagandized the vietnam war as a just cause to save the world from the evil of communism the general public and several vietnam war veterans fiercely condemned the war and believed that the government lied and misled the public even willard who is assigned the mission is cynical about his mission from the beginning charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the indy five zero zero the climax at kurtz s compound is the most confusing and the most frequently debated aspect of the film several critics believe it to be anticlimactic after the earlier more action oriented scenes and also the fact that it differs greatly from other war films in that there s no final battle scenario roger ebert in his original review defends the ending coppola doesn t have an ending if we or he expected the closing scenes to pull everything together and make sense of it nobody should have been surprised apocalypse now doesn t tell any kind of a conventional story doesn t have a thought out message for us about vietnam has no answers and thus needs no ending the way the film ends now with brando s fuzzy brooding monologues and the final violence feels much more satisfactory than any conventional ending possibly could when willard arrives he is captured and put into containment as he is interrogated by kurtz who lectures and drones on about his philosophies while other interpretations exist it can be assumed that kurtz wishes to die a soldier s death and has been waiting for his death but his followers refuse to kill him and colby scott glenn who was sent to kill him ended up joining his tribe he wishes or rather hopes that willard would be able to do so willard at first does not want to as he too is converted by kurtz s beliefs but after kurtz s monologue and his statement on judgment willard understands kurtz s desire and so decides to complete his mission by subverting his moral judgment and justifies it to himself everybody wanted me to do it him most of all i felt like he was up there waiting for me to take the pain away he just wanted to go out like a soldier standing up not like some poor wasted rag assed renegade even the jungle wanted him dead and that s who he really took his orders from anyway the jungle is seen as a metaphor to nature or more specifically man s human nature after killing kurtz willard is revered by the denizens of kurtz s tribe but he instead leaves suggesting that perhaps he is capable of escaping the horror of war responses apocalypse now premiered in one nine seven nine to mixed reviews and received polarized responses from the audiences it is said that it was as lauded as it was reviled many critics slammed the film calling it overly pretentious while others felt that it ended anticlimatically after a splendid first act roger ebert who hailed it as the best film of one nine seven nine and added it to his list of great movies stated apocalypse now is the best vietnam film one of the greatest of all films because it pushes beyond the others into the dark places of the soul it is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover today the film is regarded by many as a masterpiece of the new hollywood era it is on the afi s one zero zero years one zero zero movies list at number two eight kilgore s quote i love the smell of napalm in the morning was number one two on the afi s one zero zero years one zero zero movie quotes list sight and sound magazine polled several critics to name the best film of the last two five years and apocalypse now was named number one the catastrophic production of the film unfortunately made it symbol of the dangers of excessive directorial control over a film the production was said to have taken a toll on coppola both mentally and emotionally to many cinephiles apocalypse now is the last great film of a legendary director whose subsequent films have failed to match it in quality adaptation although inspired by joseph conrad s heart of darkness the film deviates extensively from it the novel takes place in the belgian congo in the one nine th century kurtz and marlow who is named willard in the movie are commercial agents of a belgian ivory company that brutally exploits its african native workers in the novel marlow is sent to bring the ailing kurtz home in the movie willard is sent to kill kurtz the character of kilgore is an invention of the screenwriters nevertheless coppola has maintained many episodes the spear and arrow attack on the boat for example that respect the spirit of the novel and in particular its critique of the concept of civilization and progress the fact that coppola substituted european colonization with american interventionism does not change the universal message of the book influence as one of the most iconic films of the two zero th century the film has been referenced and parodied countless times film the film was parodied in a short film called porklips now about health inspector will dullard who makes a trip to inspect the meat processing shop of a man named mertz british film nil by mouth by gary oldman has a scene where the character danny played by steve sweeney dubs the scene that the photojournalist talks to cap willard when he is

one eight nine nine two nine april one nine eight zero was a british born film director and producer closely associated with the suspense thriller genre he began directing in the united kingdom before working mostly in the united states from one nine three nine onwards taking out dual citizenship in one nine five six he directed more than fifty feature films in a career spanning six decades from the silent film era through the invention of talkies to the color era hitchcock remains one of the best known and most popular directors of all time famous for his expert and largely unrivaled control of pace and suspense throughout his movies hitchcock s films draw heavily on both fear and fantasy and are known for their droll humour they often portray innocent people caught up in circumstances beyond their control or understanding this often involves a transference of guilt in which the innocent character s failings are transferred to another character and magnified another common theme is the exploration of the compatibility of men and women hitchcock s films often take a cynical view of traditional romantic relationships although hitchcock was an enormous star during his lifetime he was not usually ranked highly by contemporaneous film critics rebecca was the only one of his films to win the academy award for best picture although four others were nominated hitchcock never won the academy award for best director he was awarded the irving g thalberg memorial award for lifetime achievement in one nine six seven but never personally received an academy award of merit the french new wave critics especially ric rohmer claude chabrol and fran ois truffaut were among the first to promote his films as having artistic merit beyond entertainment hitchcock was one of the first directors to whom they applied their auteur theory which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the film making process through his fame public persona and degree of creative control hitchcock transformed the role of the director which had previously been eclipsed by that of the producer he is seen today as the quintessential director who managed to combine art and entertainment in a way very few have ever matched his innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers producers and actors biography early life alfred hitchcock was born on august one three one eight nine nine in leytonstone london the second son and youngest of the three children of william hitchcock a greengrocer and his wife emma jane hitchcock nee whelan his family was mostly irish catholic hitchcock was sent to catholic boarding schools in london he has said his childhood was very lonely and sheltered at an early age after acting childishly hitchcock claimed that his father sent him to the local police station carrying a note when he presented the police officer on duty with the note he was locked in a cell for a few moments petrifying the young child this was a favorite anecdote of his one which is often suggested to be the cause for the theme of distrust of police which runs through many of his films at one four hitchcock lost his father and left the jesuit run st ignatius college in stamford hill his school at the time to study at the school for engineering and navigation after graduating he became a draftsman and advertising designer with a cable company about that time hitchcock became intrigued by photography and started working in film in london in one nine two zero he obtained a full time job at islington studios under its american owners players lasky and their british successors gainsborough pictures designing the titles for silent movies pre war british career as a major talent in a new industry with plenty of opportunity he rose quickly in one nine two five michael balcon of gainsborough pictures gave him a chance to direct his first film the pleasure garden made at the ufa studios in germany however the commercial failure of this film and his second the mountain eagle threatened to derail his promising career until he attached himself to the thriller genre the resulting film the lodger a story of the london fog was released in one nine two seven and was a major commercial and critical success like many of his earlier works it was influenced by expressionist techniques he had witnessed first hand in germany in it attractive blondes are strangled and the new lodger ivor novello in the bunting family s upstairs apartment falls under heavy suspicion this is the first truly hitchcockian film incorporating such themes as the wrong man following the success of the lodger hitchcock began his first efforts to promote himself in the media and hired a publicist to cement his growing reputation as one of the british film industry s rising stars in one nine two six he was to marry his assistant director alma reville they had a daughter patricia in one nine two eight alma was hitchcock s closest collaborator she wrote some of his screenplays and worked with him on every one of his films in one nine two nine he began work on blackmail his tenth film while the film was in production the studio decided to make it one of britain s first sound pictures with the climax of the film taking place on the dome of the british museum blackmail also began the hitchcock tradition of using famous landmarks as the backdrop to a story in one nine three three hitchcock was once again working for michael balcon at gaumont british picture corporation his first film for the company the man who knew too much one nine three four was a success while his second the three nine steps one nine three five is often considered one of the best films from his early period it was also one of the first to introduce the concept of the macguffin a plot device around which a whole story would revolve in the three nine steps the macguffin is a stolen set of blueprints his next major success was in one nine three eight the lady vanishes a clever and fast paced film about the search for a kindly old englishwoman dame may whitty who disappears while on board a train in the fictional country of vandrika a thinly veiled version of nazi germany by the end of the one nine three zero s hitchcock was at the top of his game artistically and in a position to name his own terms when david o selznick managed to entice the hitchcocks across to hollywood hollywood hitchcock s gallows humour continued in his american work together with the suspense that became his trademark however working arrangements with his new producer were less than optimal selznick suffered from perennial money problems and hitchcock was often unhappy with the amount of creative control demanded by selznick over his films subsequently selznick ended up loaning hitchcock to the larger studios more often than producing hitchcock s films himself with the prestigious picture rebecca in one nine four zero hitchcock made his first american movie although it was set in england and based on a novel by english author dame daphne du maurier this gothic melodrama explores the fears of a na ve young bride who enters a great english country home and must grapple with a distant husband a predatory housekeeper and the legacy of her husband s late wife it has also subsequently been noted for the lesbian undercurrents in judith anderson s performance the film won the academy award for best picture of one nine four zero hitchcock s second american film the european set thriller foreign correspondent was also nominated for best picture that year hitchcock s work during the one nine four zero s was very diverse ranging from the romantic comedy mr charlie newton teresa wright who suspects her beloved uncle charlie spencer joseph cotten of murder in its use of overlapping characters dialogue and closeups it has provided a generation of film theorists with psychoanalytic potential including jacques lacan and slavoj i ek the film also harkens to one of cotten s better known films citizen kane spellbound explored the then very fashionable subject of psychoanalysis and featured a dream sequence which was designed by salvador dali the actual dream sequence in the film was considerably cut from the original planned scene that was to run for some minutes but proved too disturbing for the finished film notorious one nine four six marked hitchcock s first film as a producer as well as director as selznick failed to see the subject s potential he allowed hitchcock to make the film for rko from this point on hitchcock would produce his own films giving him a far greater degree of freedom to pursue the projects that interested him starring ingrid bergman and hitchcock regular cary grant and featuring a plot about nazis uranium and south america notorious was a huge box office success and has remained one of hitchcock s most acclaimed films its inventive use of suspense and props briefly led to hitchcock being under surveillance by the cia due to his use of uranium as a plot device rope his first color film came next in one nine four eight here hitchcock experimented with marshalling suspense in a confined environment as he had done earlier with lifeboat he also experimented with exceptionally long takes up to ten minutes see themes and devices featuring james stewart in the leading role rope was the first of an eventual four films stewart would make for hitchcock based on the leopold and loeb case of the one nine two zero s rope is also among the earliest openly gay themed films to emerge from the hays office controlled hollywood studio era under capricorn set in nineteenth century australia also used this short lived technique but to a more limited extent for these two films he formed a production company with sidney bernstein called transatlantic pictures which folded after these two unsuccessful pictures peak years and decline with strangers on a train one nine five one his first epic film based on the novel by patricia highsmith hitchcock combined many of the best elements from his preceding british and american films two men casually meet and speculate on removing people who are causing them difficulty one of the men though takes this banter entirely seriously with farley granger reprising some elements of his role from rope strangers continued the director s interest in the narrative possiblities of homosexual blackmail and murder three very popular films all starring grace kelly followed dial m for murder was adapted from the popular stage play by frederick knott this was originally another experimental film with hitchcock using the technique of three d cinematography although the film was never released in this format rear window starred james stewart again as well as thelma ritter and raymond burr here the wheelchair bound stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has murdered his wife like lifeboat and rope the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space stewart s tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set to catch a thief set in the french riviera starred kelly and cary grant in one nine five six hitchcock also remade his one nine three four film the man who knew too much this time with james stewart and doris day one nine five eight s vertigo again starred stewart this time with kim novak and barbara bel geddes the film was a commercial failure but has come to be viewed by many as one of hitchcock s masterpieces hitchcock followed vertigo with three very different films which were all massive commercial successes all are also recognised as among his very best films north by northwest one nine five nine psycho one nine six zero and the birds one nine six three the latter two were particularly notable for their unconventional soundtracks both by bernard herrmann the screeching strings in the murder scene in psycho pushed the limits of the time and the birds dispensed completely with conventional instruments using an electronically produced soundtrack these were his last great films after which his career slowly wound down in one nine seven two hitchcock returned to london to film frenzy his last major success for the first time hitchcock allowed nudity and profane language which had before been taboo in one of his films failing health slowed down his output over the last two decades of his life family plot one nine seven six was his last film it related the escapades of madam blanche tyler played by barbara harris a fraudulent spiritualist and her taxi driver lover bruce dern making a living from her phony powers william devane and katherine helmond co starred hitchcock was created a knight commander of the order of the british empire by queen elizabeth ii in the one nine eight zero new years honours he died just four months later on april two nine before he had the opportunity to be formally invested by the queen he was nevertheless entitled to be known as sir alfred hitchcock and to use the postnominal letters kbe because he remained a british subject when he adopted american citizenship in one nine five six alfred hitchcock died from renal failure in his bel air los angeles home aged eight zero and was survived by his wife alma reville and their daughter patricia hitchcock o connell his body was cremated and apparently there was no public funeral or memorial service themes and devices hitchcock preferred the use of suspense over surprise in his films in surprise the director assaults the viewer with frightening things in suspense the director tells or shows things to the audience which the characters in the film do not know and then artfully builds tension around what will happen when the characters finally learn the truth further blurring the moral distinction between the innocent and the guilty occasionally making this indictment clear hitchcock also makes voyeurs of his respectable audience in rear window one nine five four after l b jeffries played by james stewart has been staring across the courtyard at him for most of the film lars thorwald played by raymond burr confronts jeffries by saying what do you want of me burr might as well have been addressing the audience in fact shortly before asking this thorwald turns to face the camera directly for the first time at this point audiences often gasp one of hitchcock s favourite devices for driving the plots of his stories and creating suspense was what he called the macguffin the plots of many of his suspense films revolve around a macguffin a detail which by inciting curiosity and desire drives the plot and motivates the actions of characters within the story but whose specific identity and nature is unimportant to the spectator of the film in vertigo for instance carlotta valdes is a macguffin she never appears and the details of her death are unimportant

characters must recover before it reaches nazi hands serves as a similarly arbitrary motivation any dangerous object would suffice and state secrets of various kinds serve as macguffins in several of the spy films like the three nine steps most of hitchcock s films contain cameo appearances by hitchcock himself the director would be seen for a brief moment boarding a bus crossing in front of a building standing in an apartment across the courtyard or appearing in a photograph this playful gesture became one of hitchcock s signatures as a recurring theme he would carry a musical instrument especially memorable was the large double bass case that he wrestles onto the train at the beginning of strangers on a train in his earliest appearances he would fill in as an obscure extra standing in a crowd or walking through a scene in a long camera shot but he became more prominent in his later appearances as when he turns to see jane wyman s disguise when she passes him on the street in stage fright and in stark silhouette in his final film family plot in another amusing cameo albeit just a photograph hitchcock s picture is seen in the
